265SG2c  E=116, 121 MeV using the U400 cyclotron at Dubna and the H-gas filled

265SGAc  Separated EVR's passed through a tof counter and impinged              
265SG4c  on a position sensitive surface barrier detector. Four                 
265SG5c  |a-|a-(|a) correlations at 121 MeV were attributed to this             
265SG6c  nucleus with E|a=8.71-8.91 MeV at a production cross-section of 260 pb 
265SG7c  accurate to within an approximate factor of three. Average             
265SGAc  E|a=8.82 MeV for the four events (evaluators), with a                  
265SGAc  detector resolution of |?100 keV (1998Tu01).

265SGAc  seaborgium isotopes could not Be measured due to the lack of the       
265SGAc  initial                                                                
265SG9c  implantation signal in the silicon detectors, the experimenters used   
265SGAc  the Viola-Seaborg relation to estimate an |a-half life of 2 to 30 s    
265SGBc  with a HF of 1-3. |a-branching was estimated to Be|>50%. The           
265SGCc  assignment was based on properties of rutherfordium known at the time. 
265SGAc  2006Dv01 reassign 6 |a-SF events to {+265}Sg decaying to the second    
265SGAc  state in {+261}Rf which was unknown at the time of this experiment. The
265SGAc  average E|a=8.63 MeV for these 6 events (evaluators).                  
265SG c  1996Ho13: descendent of {+277}112 produced by {+208}Pb({+70}Zn,n),     
265SG2c  E=343.8 MeV (E*=10.1 MeV; |s=1.0 pb {I+18-4}) at GSI/SHIP. Two         
265SG3c  EVR-|a1-|a2-|a3-|a4-|a5-|a6 events observed. First event retracted by  
265SG4c  2002Ho11; |s revised to 0.4 pb {I+9-3}. See {+277}112 Adopted Levels   
265SG5c  in 2005Gu33 for details. One energy-time correlation recorded with one 
265SG6c  escaped particle for this nucleus with a time interval of 7.4 s.       
265SG c  1996La12: descendant of {+273}Ds using the hot fusion reaction         
265SG2c  {+244}Pu({+34}S,5n) E=190 MeV at Dubna using DGFRS in collaboration    
265SG3c  with LLNL. The cross-section was about 0.4 pb for {+273}Ds. 14         
265SG4c  candidate events for {+273}Ds were measured in beam-off conditions,    
265SGAc  of which one EVR-|a1-|a3-|a4 event was                                 
265SG5c  considered to Be the most likely. See {+273}Ds Adopted Levels in       
265SG6c  2005Gu33 for details. The energy window was set at 8.5 to 9.0 MeV for  
265SGAc  {+265}Sg with a time window of 360 s following the emission of the     
265SGAc  first |a. Suggested properties from the most likely single event are   
265SG7c  E|a=8.63 MeV {I6} with a lifetime of 158 s corresponding to            
265SGAc  T{-1/2}=110 s. For this event, the small non-zero value of             
265SG8c  6|*10{+-3} for random fourfold correlations over the entire time of    
265SG9c  measurement (1375 h) for the whole PSD array does not rule out the     
265SGAc  possibility of a random sequence. Additionally,                        
265SGAc  the 8.63 MeV |a was accompanied by a low amplitude |DE signal about    
265SGAc  60% of the time within 5 |mS. Preliminary results suggest that         
265SGAc  the likely source for the signal could Be the conversion electron      
265SGAc  associated with the decay of {+261}Rf and {+257}No since odd-A 265Sg   
265SGAc  decays preferentially to an excited state in {+261}Rf.                 
265SG c  1997Sc48, 1997Sc49: produced in the hot fusion reaction                
265SG2c  {+248}Cm({+22}Ne,5n) E=121 MeV at GSI using the UNILAC. Two chemical   
265SG3c  separation techniques were used in these studies intended to study the 
265SG4c  chemical properties of Sg. 1997Sc48 reports results of the first       
265SG5c  aqueous chemistry for Sg using the ARCA setup (1989Sc42). It was not   
265SG6c  possible to determine a half-life for Sg. The decay of {+265}Sg was    
265SG7c  not seen although the presence of {+261}Rf and and {+257}No as         
265SG8c  daughter products indicate the production of the parent. 1997Sc49      
265SG9c  report results from gas chromatography using the OLGA III (1996Tu05)   
265SGAc  setup. Three decay chains attributable to to {+265}Sg were             
265SGBc  unambigiously measured with the following properties: E|a=8.81, 8.82   
265SGAc  and 8.86 MeV |+ 6 (FWHM) with average E|a=8.83 MeV |+ 6.               
265SGAc  |t=2.8, 27.3 and 0.6 s,                                                
265SGCc  respectively corresponding to an average T{-1/2}=7.1 s {I+97-26}       
265SGAc  for the three events (evaluators). Both studies indicate               
265SGAc  that Sg is chemically                                                  
265SGDc  similar to the lighter homologues Mo and W and its behaviour is typical
265SGEc  of group 6 elements. 1997Sc48 rule out pseudo-group 6, U-like behavior 
265SGFc  for Sg. See also 1998Sc50 and 1999Tu04 for chemistry. 2006Dv01         
265SGAc  believe that the event attributed to {+266}Sg in 1997Sc49 should Be    
265SGAc  reassigned to {+265}Sg decaying to the 'second' level in {+261}Rf which
265SGAc  was unknown at the time.                                               
265SG c  1998Tu01: produced by the hot fusion reaction {+248}Cm({+22}Ne,5n)     
265SG2c  E=121, 123 MeV at the GSI UNILAC; see also {+266}Sg Adopted Levels in  
265SG3c  2005Gu33. The reaction cross-section deduced for the |a-decay branch   
265SG4c  was about 250 pb. Chemical separation of volatile Sg oxychlorides      
265SGAc  was achieved with                                                      
265SG5c  OLGA (1996Tu05) using isothermal chromatography. Group 6 elements      
265SG6c  which passed through the column were transported to a 64-position      
265SG7c  rotating wheel system ROMA (1984SuZW). PIPS detectors were used to     
265SG8c  measure the nuclides of interest. The daughter mode (DM) mode was used 
265SG9c  to measure time and position of correlated parent-daughter |a-decay    
265SGAc  events.

265SGEc  to Be 0.83. For 11 decay chains not in DM mode, the same number was    
265SGFc  4.79. Highest confidence was placed on triple coincidences measured    
265SGGc  in chain 5 which had a randomness probability of 0.04. A total         
265SGHc  of 13 |a-decay chains were attributed to {+265}Sg. 4 |a-energy         
265SGIc  groups were proposed with E|a=8.69 MeV {I3} (8%), 8.76 MeV {I3} (23%), 
265SGJc  8.84 MeV {I3} (46%) and 8.94 MeV {I3} (23%). From a two component      
265SGKc  maximum likelyhood decay curve analysis the half-life was deduced to Be
265SGLc  7.4 s {I+33-27} for {+265}Sg. A sub-group of runs was undertaken to    
265SGMc  determine the SF branch. Five SF decays were seen possibly from        
265SGNc  {+265}Sg although other decaying products were not excluded. From the  
265SGOc  analysis of three events with 24.3, 27.2 and 43.6 secs, the upper      
265SGPc  limit of the fission branch was estimated |<35% {I16}. The lower limit 
265SGQc  on the SF half-life was |>13 s. The corresponding partial |a-decay     
265SGac  T{-1/2} was 4.7 to 16.5 s (68% c.i.).                                  
265SG c  The three events originally assigned to {+266}Sg were reassigned to    
265SGAc  {+265}Sg via 2006Dv01 and taken into account (as events 17 to 19) by   
265SGAc  2008Du09.                                                              
265SGac  Note that Events 14-16 (in parentheses above)                          
265SGac  have a high degree of randomness and were not                          
265SGac  included in the re-evaluation by 2008Du09.

265SGAc  reassigned to {+265}Sg in the analysis by 2008Du09 and are therefore   
265SGAc  discussed here. Reaction products were transported to the

265SGAc  With the expected cross-section of 60 pb (1998Tu01) for                
265SGAc  the 4{In} channel, the production rate was about 0.8 h{+-1}.           
265SGAc  Reaction products of interest leaving the chromatography column        
265SGAc  were deposited on ROMA with a step interval of 10 s.                   
265SGAc  15 PIPS detectors were used to measure                                 
265SGAc  |a-SF correlations within a time period of 150 s after collection.     
265SGAc  A high level of contamination from polonium isotopes was present.      
265SGAc  Two |a-SF events were measured in the energy window of 8.61 to 8.75    
265SGAc  MeV attributed to {+266}Sg and {+262}Rf: E|a{-1}=8.66 MeV, |t{-1}=84.9 
265SGAc  s and |t(SF)=7.0 s;                                                    
265SGAc  E|a{-2}=8.70 MeV, |t{-2}=4.8 s, |t(SF)=3.7 s. The energy               
265SGAc  resolution achieved was 28 keV (FWHM). From both events,               
265SGAc  probabilities of randomness were 0.82 (no random), 0.16 (one random)   
265SGAc  and 2% (both random). Production cross-sections were 60 pb +106-17 for 
265SGAc  both events and 27 pb +110-17 for one event. Evaluators note that      
265SG7c  average E|a=8.680 MeV |+ 28 corresponding to T{-1/2}=31 s {I+57-12}    
265SGAc  (Sg). The two-event SF T{-1/2}(SF)=4 s {I+7-2} (Rf).                   
265SGAc  Experimenters conclude that Sg shows properties typical to             
265SGAc  group 6 elements as well as an uranium(VI) like behavior which is      
265SGAc  also known to form a volatile oxide hydroxide.                         
265SG c  2002Ho11: descendant of {+277}112. The experiment of 1996Ho13 was      
265SG2c  redone at GSI/SHIP. The {+208}Pb({+70}Zn,n) reaction was again used at 
265SG3c  projectile energies of 346.1 MeV (E*=12.0 MeV; |s=0.5 pb {I+11-4};     
265SG4c  1 event) and 343.8 MeV (E*=10.1 MeV; |s<2.6 pb; 0 events).

265SGAc  From the two remaining chains recorded the |a particles from the       
265SGAc  decay of {+265}Sg escaped. The half-life computed was 9 s {I+17-4}.    
265SGAc  From the individual lifetimes, the |a particle energies were estimated 
265SGAc  to Be 8.75 MeV (|t=4.6 s) and 8.62 MeV (|t=18.8 s).

265SGAc  While the results from this experiment are contradictory to            
265SGAc  earlier reports, they also differ from the properties of               
265SG7c  {+266}Sg and {+270}Hs adopted in 2005Gu33.                             
265SGAc  2006Dv01 suggest that data pertaining to these nuclides from earlier   
265SG7c  studies are more consistent with decays from {+265}Sg and {+269}Hs and 
265SGAc  were erroneously assigned to {+266}Sg and {+270}Hs whose properties    
265SG8c  stand revised via this work. The quantities adopted in 2005Gu33        
265SGAc  were in consonance with claims made by the various experimental        
265SGAc  groups, some of which cited 'unambigious' results for these nuclides.  
265SGAc  It is worthwhile to note that many of the early studies were           
265SGAc  designed primarily to                                                  
265SGAc  measure chemical properties such as the greatly increased volatility   
265SGAc  of chlorides of trans-actinides ({Ii.e.} elements above Z=103).        
265SGAc  Hence, the experimental focus                                          
265SGAc  was mainly on the transmission of SF                                   
265SGAc  activity through a suitable detection system indicative of the         
265SGAc  nuclide and chemical species of interest being formed (or its          
265SGAc  absence), rather than on the                                           
265SGAc  accurate measurement of a half-life. Two other                         
265SGAc  experimental deficiencies resulting                                    
265SGAc  in the non-recognition of a second state in daughter {+261}Rf which    
265SGAc  would otherwise have provided a vital clue,                            
265SGAc  may have aided earlier interpretations.                                
265SGAc  Chemistry experiments employed hot fusion reactions                    
265SGAc  with actinide targets which are known to lead to a relatively large SF 
265SGAc  background when compared to Pb-target based cold fusion reactions.     
265SGAc  This non-negligible SF background                                      
265SGAc  through most of the chemical studies could have hampered               
265SGAc  the identification of the second state of {+261}Rf (2008Du09).         
265SGAc  Additionally, the presence of {+212}Po (E|a=8.52 MeV, I{-|a}=2.05%)    
265SGAc  from transfer reactions caused by the projectile on Pb impurites       
265SGAc  in the target, may have also hindered                                  
265SGAc  the detection of the 'second' daughter state with almost               
265SGAc  the same E|a, energy gate permitting.

265SGAc  means are required to make

265SG c  2006Ni10: in a study of the reaction {+238}U({+30}Si,xn)268Sg at GSI   
265SG2c  using the UNILAC and SHIP. The SHIP setup was similar to               
265SGAc  earlier work.                                                          
265SG3c  In this experiment, higher energy SF fragments were measured with      
265SG4c  additional electronics which allowed the detection of energies up to   
265SG5c  320 MeV. An additional Si PIPS detector was used to detect inelastic   
265SG6c  reaction products behind the stop detector. A clover detector with     
265SG7c  four crystals was also mounted behind the stop detector to measure     
265SG8c  coincident x-rays or |g's. The probability of randomness from 208Pb    
265SG9c  impurities was estimated to Be 1|*10{+-4} for the observation of one   
265SGAc  SF event in each of the three {+30}Si+{+238}U irradiations. One event  
265SGBc  with an escaped |a particle was attributed to {+265}Sg. The event      
265SGCc  life-time was 15.2 s corresponding to T{-1/2}=10.2 s. 2006Ni10         
265SGDc  assigned the event to {+265}Sg due to the agreement with an "AVERAGE"  
265SGEc  half-life of 7.9 s {I+64-24} computed by 2006Ni10 from three events    
265SGFc  reported in 2003Tu05 and two events in 2002Ho11. The SF fragments were 
265SGGc  attributed to the known 100% fission branch from the 3.6 s {I+23-11}   
265SGHc  state in daughter {+261}Rf. A |g of energy 1172 keV was measured in    
265SGIc  coincidence with the SF decay in the clover detector. The production   
265SGJc  cross-section was 3.5 pb {I+81-29} at E{_c.m.}=133.0 MeV.

265SG2c  Confirmatory experiments performed by the Japanese group at RIKEN with 
265SG3c  {+208}Pb({+70}Zn,n) E=345.9 MeV (|s=0.44 pb {I+59-29}). Two            
265SG4c  EVR-|a1-|a2-|a3-|a4-SF events observed. Confirmed results of 2002Ho11. 
265SG5c  See {+277}112 Adopted Levels in 2005Gu33 for details. Randomness       
265SG6c  factors are provided in 2007Mo09. The improved half-life for {+265}Sg  
265SG7c  is suggested as 22 s {I+22-8}. 2007Mo09 note that while E|a of         
265SG8c  grand-parent {+269}Hs from 2006Dv01 is somewhat low when compared to   
265SGAc  their results, the |a energies for {+265}Sg and decay properties of    
265SGxc  {+261}Rf are consistent.

265SGAc  {+248}Cm({+22}Ne,{Ix}n){+270-{Ix}}Sg was undertaken in an attempt to   
265SGAc  address existing ambiguities in deduced properties due to the varying  
265SGAc  quality of older data and taking into account re-assignments suggested 
265SGAc  in 2006Dv01. Decay properties previously                               
265SGAc  assigned to {+266}Sg in 1994La22, 1996La12, 1998Tu01, 2001Hu22,        
265SGAc  2003Tu05 and 2004Vo24 are re-examined together with new                
265SGAc  data from 2006Dv01                                                     
265SGAc  and 2008Dv02.                                                          
265SGAc  A total of 60 events are considered for {+265}Sg and {+261}Rf following
265SGAc  re-assignments.                                                        
265SGAc  Strong indications for two states (a and b) in {+265}Sg are suggested  
265SGAc  although it is not possible to conclusively deduce which is the        
265SGAc  ground state due to the poor quality of data.                          
265SGAc  From available data on the production of {+265}Sg as an EVR the        
265SGAc  isomeric population ratio |s({+265}Sg{+a})/|s({+265}Sg{+b})=23/17|?1.4 
265SGac  is deduced. Directly produced {+265}Sg decays with a combined          
265SGAc  T{-1/2}=10.5 s {I+26-17} (26 events where |a decays were observed) are 
265SGAc  consistent with the mixing of levels observed from the |a spectra.     
265SGAc  New decay properties attributed to this nucleus are                    
265SG4c  {+265}Sg{+a}: E|a=8.80 - 8.90 MeV; T{-1/2}=8.9 s {I+27-19};            
265SGAc  {+265}Sg{+b}: E|a=8.70 MeV; T{-1/2}=16.2 s {I+47-35}. 91% of           
265SGAc  the |a-decays from the parent {+269}Hs feed the {+265}Sg{+b} state.    
265SGAc  Deduced decay branchings to the two suggested states in the            
265SGAc  daughter nucleus were 80% for {+265}Sg{+a} to {+261}Rf{+a} and         
265SGAc  88% for {+265}Sg{+b} to {+261}Rf{+b} as shown in the erratum.

265SGac  and 240 nb (121/123 MeV, 1998Tu01) are revised to 320 nb and 206 nb    
265SGAc  respectively. Recalculated cross-sections for 1998Tu01 and 2001Hu22    
265SGac  are multiplied by a factor of 2.2 to correct for the fact that these   
265SGac  studies were not sensitive to all known decay paths for {+265}Sg.      
265SGac  The correction is applied taking into account |a-|a(-|a) chains        
265SGac  neglected in the PSI and HITGAS experiments which were sensitive       
265SGac  only to |a-SF chains. The corrected values are shown in figure 5.      
265SGAc  Other recalculated cross sections for the {+248}Cm({+22}Ne,5n)

265SGac  80 nb (116 MeV, 1994La22), 78 nb (119 MeV, 1998Tu01) and 92 nb         
265SGac  (119 MeV, 1996Ka66).                                                   
265SGac  The peak reaction cross-section for {+248}Cm({+22}Ne,5n)               
265SGac  is of the order of a few hundred pico barns and in agreement with      
265SGAc  experimental systematics of simlar reactions. Revised values lie       
265SGAc  about a factor of three                                                
265SGac  to four higher than theoretical (HIVAP) predictions.                   
265SGAc  Decay modes other than |a decay could not

265SGAc  RIKEN using the GARIS set up. The beam was provided by                 
265SGAc  the RIKEN linear accelerator (RILAC) at an energy of 117.8 MeV at the  
265SGAc  middle of target. EVR's were separated in flight and transported to    
265SGAc  the focal plane of garis with an estimated efficiency of 13% for the   
265SGAc  collection of {+265}Sg. The atoms were thermalised in a gas jet chamber
265SGAc  and delivered to a rotating wheel setup MANON (Measurement system      
265SGAc  for Alpha-particle and spontaneous fissioN events ON-line) for         
265SGAc  |a/SF spectrometry. The combined set-up allowed for extremely low      
265SGAc  background conditions to enable a detailed study of this nuclide.      
265SGAc  Two |a decay energies as suggested by 2008Du09 were clearly visible.   
265SGAc  At E|>8.76 MeV a total of 18 decay events were reported with an        
265SGAc  average E|a=8.84|+0.05 MeV consistent with the assignment to           
265SGAc  {+265}Sg{+a} by 2008Du09. For the lower energy group with E<8.76 MeV,  
265SGAc  24 events with an average energy E|a=8.69|+0.05 were reported          
265SGAc  consistent with the {+265}Sg{+b} state assigned by 2008Du09. The       
265SGAc  respective half lives were 8.5 s {I+26-16} and 14.4 s {I+37-25} (68%   
265SGAc  c.i.) in agreement with the analysis of 2008Du09. Decay branchings to  
265SGAc  two states in the daughter nucleus were 91% for {+265}Sg{+a} to        
265SGAc  {+261}Rf{+a} and 80% for {+265}Sg{+b} to {+261}Rf{+b}.                 
265SGAc  Details of assignments for 79 observed                                 
265SGAc  events are provided in Table II. It was not possible to directly       
265SGAc  measure SF decay from this nuclide. Derived upper limits for SF        
265SGAc  decay were |<0.50 and |<0.51 (68% c.i.) for {+265}Sg{+a} and           
265SGAc  {+265}Sg{+b} respectively. Production cross-sections were              
265SGAc  180 pb +80-60 (10 events) and 200 pb +60-50 (19 events) for            
265SGAc  {+265}Sg{+a} and {+265}Sg{+b} at the beam energy and efficiency        
265SGAc  provided. The total cross-section was                                  
265SGAc  |s({+265}Sg{+a}+{+265}Sg{+b})=380 pb +90-70. The authors state that    
265SGAc  the cross-section ratio                                                
265SGAc  |s({+265}Sg{+a})/|s({+265}Sg{+b})=1.3|+0.5 from all observed events    
265SGAc  {+265}Sg{+a}/{+265}Sg{+b}=18/24 which the evaluators note to Be 0.8.

265SGAc  {+208}Pb({+70}Zn,n){+277}Cn at RIKEN. The target was bombarded by      
265SGAc  {+70}Zn projectiles at three beam energies: 347.5, 351.5 and 355.5 MeV.
265SGAc  The reaction products were separated in-flight by                      
265SGAc  GARIS. Experiments were performed from June 17, 2011 through November  
265SGAc  30, 2011 with a total dose of 2.31 x 10{+19} ions impinging on the     
265SGAc  target. A single event was observed at a beam energy of 351.5 MeV.     
265SGAc  The fourth decay in the sequence was attributed to {+265}Sg{+b} by     
265SGAc  comparison to known properties. The event had an E|a=8.66 |+ 0.08 MeV  
265SGAc  and T{-1/2}=20 s {I+15-6}.
