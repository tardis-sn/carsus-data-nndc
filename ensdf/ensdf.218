218  3c  {+218}At and {+218}Pa, data are available only for the ground states.  
218  5c  For {+218}U, only the g.s. and a high-spin isomer are known, with no

218  7c  are known from {+218}Bi decay, with no knowledge on the

218PB c  2010Al24 (also 2009Al32): {+218}Pb nuclide identified in               
218PB2c  {+9}Be({+238}U,X),E=1 GeV/nucleon. The {+238}U beam was produced by the
218PB3c  SIS synchrotron at GSI facility. Target={+9}Be, 2500 mg/cm{+2} thick.  
218PB4c  The fragment residues were analyzed with the high resolving power      
218PB5c  magnetic spectrometer Fragment separator (FRS). The identification of  
218PB6c  nuclei was made on the basis of magnetic rigidity, velocity,           
218PB7c  time-of-flight, energy loss and atomic number of the fragments using   
218PB8c  two plastic scintillators and two multisampling ionization chambers.   
218PB9c  The FRS magnet was tuned to center on {+210}Au, {+216}Pb, {+219}Pb,    
218PBAc  {+227}At and {+229}At nuclei, along the central trajectory of the FRS. 
218PBBc  Unambiguous identification of nuclides required the separation of      
218PBCc  different charge states of the nuclei passing through the FRS. At 1    
218PBDc  GeV/nucleon incident energy of {+238}U, the fraction of fully stripped 
218PBEc  {+226}Po nuclei was about 89%. Through the measurement of difference in
218PBFc  magnetic rigidity in the two sections of the FRS and the difference    
218PBGc  in energy loss in the two ionization chambers, the charge state of     
218PBHc  the transmitted nuclei was determined, especially, that of the singly  
218PBIc  charged (hydrogen-like) nuclei which preserved their charge in the     
218PBJc  current experimental setup. Measured production cross sections.        
218PBKc  Criterion stated in 2010Al24 for acceptance of identification of       
218PBLc  a new nuclide were: 1. number of events should be compatible with the  
218PBMc  corresponding mass and atomic number located in the expected range     
218PBNc  of positions at both the image planes of the FRS spectrometer; 2.      
218PBOc  number of events should be compatible with >95% probability, that at   
218PBPc  least one of the counts did not correspond to a charge-state           
218PBQc  contaminant. Comparisons of measured |s was made with the model        
218PBRc  predictions using the COFRA and EPAX computer codes.

218PB4c  separated and identified by the GSI Fragment Separator (FRS) using     
218PB5c  B|r-|DE-B|r technique. The FRS tracking detectors were four            
218PB6c  time-projection chambers (TPCs), two ionization chambers, and thin     
218PB7c  plastic scintillators for tof measurement. Mass-over-charge (A/Q)      
218PB8c  ratios were measured for ions analyzed on an event-by-event basis.

218RN3cL in the opinion of the evaluators, |g rays to g.s. are probably

218RN3cG note that random summing cannot be excluded from this observed         
218RN4cG transition. Adopted J|p assignments give an M4 multipolarity for the   
218RN5cG 653|g transition and considering I|g(516|g)=0.00142 {I8} for the       
218RN6cG competing E1 depopulating transition, the transition strength for      
218RN7cG 653|g would be more than 10{+6} W.u. larger than the E1 transition.    
218RN8cG Thus, the evaluators consider the 653|g to have resulted from

218RA c  The level scheme given here is mainly that of 1989Sc33.                
218RA2c  The main two bands of the level scheme were constructed in their       
218RA3c  earlier work, 1982Fe04; with subsequent confirmation by 1983Ga11       
218RA4c  and 1986Go21, except with the revised ordering of the 389-352 cascade. 
218RA4c  The 3- member of the negative-parity band                              
218RA7c  was assigned by 1983Ga11 and confirmed by 1992Wi14.                    
218RA c  From lifetime measurements, 1988Ga33 conclude that higher spin         
218RA2c  states exhibit enhanced B(E1) rates of about 0.006 which may be a      
218RA3c  result of collective dipole deexcitations from a reflection-
