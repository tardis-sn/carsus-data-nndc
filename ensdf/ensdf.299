29920 c  $ 2016Ho09 searched for production of element 120 using the            
299202c  {+248}Cm({+54}Cr,3n) reaction at GSI.  Three correlated |a decays      
299203c  were observed, followed by a high-energy event which could be          
299204c  spontaneous fission, were observed.  The energy and decay time of the  
299205c  final |a decay are in agreement with the properties of {+291}Lv.       
299206c  However, an implantation event could not be identified unambiguously.  
299207c  The time between the final |a decay and the potential                  
299208c  spontaneous-fission event is also much longer than most other          
299209c  published data.                                                        
29920 c  $ 2017He11 presents a reanalysis of the data in 2016Ho09 and concludes 
299202c  that the three events are background events rather than a decay chain.
