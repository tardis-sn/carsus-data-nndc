 17C  c  XUNDL set compiled by F.G. Kondev, ANL, August 2008                    
 17C  c  The experiment was performed at the RIKEN Accelerator Research Facility
 17C 2c  using a {+18}C secondary beam from the RIKEN                           
 17C 3c  Projectile-fragment Separator (RIPS). The secondary beam was produced  
 17C 4c  by fragmenting 110 MeV/nucleon {+22}Ne ions                            
 17C 5c  on a 1.02 g/cm{+2} {+9}Be production target with a typical             
 17C 6c  beam intensity of 320 pnA. Particle identification of the {+18}C       
 17C 7c  beam was performed on an event-by-event basis by means of the ToF-|DE  
 17C 8c  method using two 1.0 mm thick plastic scintillation counters, placed   
 17C 9c  5.1 m apart along the beam line. The {+18}C secondary beam had a       
 17C ac  typical intensity of 2.3|*10{+4} counts per second with a purity of    
 17C bc  about 60%, and was directed onto a 370 mg/cm{+2} {+9}Be reaction target
 17C cc  set at the final focal plane of RIPS. Positions and incident angles of 
 17C dc  the secondary beam particles were recorded with two sets of parallel   
 17C ec  plate avalanche counters (PPACs) placed upstream of the reaction       
 17C fc  target. Outgoing particles were detected by a plastic scintillator     
 17C gc  hodoscope, located 3.8 m downstream of the target. The scattering angle
 17C hc  of the particle was determined by combining the hit position on the    
 17C ic  hodoscope with those on the PPACs for the incoming particles.          
 17C  c  Detectors: 130 NaI(Tl) detectors from the DALI and                     
 17C 2c  DALI2 arrays, divided into ten                                         
 17C 3c  separate layers, surrounded the target to detect deexciting |g rays.   
 17C  c  Measured: E|g, |g(|q) and T{-1/2}. The lifetime measurements were      
 17C 2c  performed by employing the recoil shadow method                        
 17C 3c  with intermediate-energy radioactive-isotope beams. In this method,    
 17C 4c  the lifetime is obtained by observing the angular distribution of |g   
 17C 5c  rays emitted from excited {+17}C nuclei in flight.

 17C  c  The authors measured the lifetimes of relatively long-lived states in  
 17C 2c  {+17}C using the TRIple PLunger for EXotic beams (TRIPLEX).            
 17C  c  A beam of 74.2 MeV/nucleon {+18}C ions was produced by fragmenting a   
 17C 2c  {+22}Ne beam on a {+9}Be target at the NSCL/A1900 fragment separator.  
 17C 3c  The beam impinged on a 370 mg/cm{+2} {+9}Be target located             
 17C 4c  at the target position of the S800 spectrometer, where the TRIPLEX     
 17C 5c  plunger system was located. The TRIPLEX comprised the {+9}Be target    
 17C 6c  and a set of 1640 and 950 mg/cm{+2} Ta energy degrading targets that   
 17C 7c  were located at variable distances from the Be target. De-excitation   
 17C 8c  |g rays from the decay of {+17}C states, produced in                   
 17C 9c  {+9}Be({+18}C,{+17}C*) reactions, were observed using the GRETINA      
 17C ac  array, which covered |q=25|' to 90|'. Two de-excitation peaks were     
 17C bc  observed at E{-|g}=218 keV {I1} and 332 keV {I1}. Analysis of the      
 17C cc  intensities of the velocity dependent Doppler shifted |g rays, after   
 17C dc  each plunger degrader, permitted a determination of the lifetime of    
 17C ec  the parent states. The center Ta degrader of the plunger device was    
 17C fc  located to give optimal lifetime sensitivity.                          
 17C  c  Finally, B(M1) values are deduced for the two observed transitions.    
 17C 2c  Pure M1 decay is assumed for the observed transitions, but for the     
 17C 3c  E{-|g}=218 keV {I1} (J{+|p}=1/2+ to 3/2+) transition, in

 17C 7c  {+17}C and transition rate was included, especially on the roles

 17C 3c  beam impinging on either a tantalum or a carbon target and was selected
 17C 4c  using the LISE spectrometer. The |b-particles were                     
 17C 5c  detected by a plastic scintillator while the delayed neutrons

 17C 2c  Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a               
 17C 3c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 17C 4c  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The          
 17C 5c  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
 17C 6c  nuclides. The neutrons were detected in a polyethylene moderate {+3}He 
 17C 7c  counter, and standard techniques were implemented. The |b-delayed      
 17C 8c  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
 17C 9c  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons

 17C  c  1996Ra02: A beam of {+17}B ions was produced by fragmenting a {+22}Ne  
 17C 2c  beam on a {+9}Be target. The beam was magnetically separated, degraded 
 17C 3c  to lower energies, and finally stopped in a plastic scintillator.      
 17C 4c  The implantation detector was sandwiched between four other            
 17C 5c  scintillator |b-ray detectors.                                         
 17C 6c  A valid {+17}|b decay event required a coincidence between three       
 17C 7c  ajacent detectors. Three neutron walls surrounded the implantation     
 17C 8c  target and covered about 1.4 sr. The decay neutron energy was          
 17C 9c  deduced by the time of flight between the implantation detector and    
 17C Ac  the neutron wall detectors.                                            
 17C  c  The measured neutron spectrum shows two prominent decay groups         
 17C 2c  of {+17}B |b delayed neutrons at E{-n}=2.91 and 1.80 MeV, as           
 17C 3c  well as a strong peak at E{-n}=0.82 MeV from the {+16}N daughter decay.
 17C 4c  A full analysis of the neutron energy spectrum revealed two neutron    
 17C 5c  groups corresponding to known branches in {+16}N decay and four groups 
 17C 6c  at E{-n}=0.42, 1.43, 1.80 and 2.91 MeV that are attributed to          
 17C 7c  neutron decay from {+17}C to {+16}C{-g.s.}.                            
 17C 8c  In later works, the E{-n}=1.43 MeV branch is attributed to decay to    
 17C 9c  {+16}C*(1766) while the E{-n}=0.42 MeV branch is not found.            
 17C Ac  In 1996Ra02, the results are presented by

 17C 2c  An E({+22}Ne)=110 MeV/nucleon beam was fragmented in a 1.07 g/cm{+2}   
 17C 3c  {+93}Nb target and the {+17}B ions at |q{-lab}=1.5|'-5.0|' were        
 17C 4c  accepted in the RIKEN/RIPS fragment separator. The {+17}B beam was     
 17C 5c  then implanted at the center of a stack of four 100 |mm thick Pt       
 17C 6c  stopper foils which were held in a 50 mT magnetic field. A |b-NMR      
 17C 7c  technique was implemented to maximize the sensitivity to spin          
 17C 8c  dependent observables.                                                 
 17C  c  Two plastic scintillators were placed in positions above and below the 
 17C 2c  Pt foil stack and were used to detect |b-rays from decays in the foil. 
 17C 3c  Coincidences among the two foils were used to reject events, for       
 17C 4c  example, from cosmic-ray events.                                       
 17C  c  Neutron bound and neutron unbound states in {+17}C could be populated  
 17C 2c  in the decay, and furthermore the neutron-unbound levels can decay with
 17C 3c  low-energy or high-energy neutron emission.                            
 17C 4c  A 12 element plastic scintillator high-energy neutron detector array   
 17C 5c  (E{-n}|?0.5-10 MeV) covered |W{-n}=0.21|*4|p sr with a 5.6%            
 17C 6c  efficiency for detecting 1 MeV neutrons. The neutron energies          
 17C 7c  were determined by time-of-flight where the |b-ray signal provided a   
 17C 8c  start signal and the neutron array provided the stop signal            
 17C 9c  (1.5 m flight path).                                                   
 17C ac  A 10 element plastic scintillator low-energy neutron detector array    
 17C bc  (E{-n}|>0.01 MeV) covered |W{-n}=0.037|*4|p sr with a                  
 17C cc  0.5 m flight path.                                                     
 17C  c  A HPGe clover detector and four NaI(Tl) detectors measured the emitted 
 17C 2c  |g-rays. Plastic scintillator detectors covered the front faces of the 
 17C 3c  detectors and helped reject |b-rays entering the |g-ray detectors. The 
 17C 4c  plastic scintillators plus NaI(Tl) detectors were also used to measure 
 17C 5c  the |b-ray energy spectrum.                                            
 17C  c  The decay curve of photopeak counts is evaluated and constraints are   
 17C 2c  placed to guide consideration of transitions resulting from levels fed 
 17C 3c  by {+17}B |b-decay or {+17}B |b{+-}Xn decay. In the case of 0-n decay  
 17C 4c  to neutron bound levels of {+17}C, the |g-ray transitions with         
 17C 5c  energies below the neutron separation energy, Sn|?730 keV (2012Wa38),  
 17C 6c  were evaluated.                                                        
 17C 7c  Transitions with E|g=217, 295 and 331 keV were identified as           
 17C 8c  possible decays in {+17}C. However because feeding to low-lying states 
 17C 9c  of {+17}C can be connected with emission of high energy |b-rays the    
 17C ac  |g-ray spectra were analyzed with the condition of a coincident        
 17C bc  E|b|>10 MeV |b-ray; only peaks corresponding to E|g=217 and 331 keV    
 17C cc  were found.                                                            
 17C 7c  Analysis of |b-|g-|g coincidences yielded no results, so the {+17}B    
 17C 8c  0n-|b decay is found to decay to {+17}C*(217, 331) which then |g-decay 
 17C 9c  to the {+17}C ground state.                                            
 17C  c  Numerous other time correlated |g-ray transitions (connected with      
 17C 2c  decay of levels fed by |b-xn decay) and time uncorrelated              
 17C 3c  |g-transitions (connected with subsequent |b-decay of daughters) are   
 17C 4c  characterized.                                                         
 17C  c  The E{-n}=0.82 MeV neutron group is correlated with the neutron        
 17C 2c  emission group from {+16}N*(3353)|){+15}N{-g.s.} that is populated in  
 17C 3c  84.4% (1976Al02) of {+16}C decay events. This branching ratio is used  
 17C 4c  with the presently observed intensity of the E{-n}=0.82 MeV neutron    
 17C 5c  group to obtain %|b{+-}1n=(67 {I7})% for {+17}B decay.                 
 17C  c  The E|g=5299 keV transition is identified in the |g-ray spectrum and is
 17C 2c  connected with |b{+-}2n decay to {+15}C, which then |b-decays to       
 17C 3c  {+15}N. The E|g=5299 keV |g-ray is populated in 63.2% of {+15}C decays 
 17C 4c  (1984Wa07); this branching ratio is used with the presently observed   
 17C 5c  %I|g(5290)=(7.5 {I11})% to deduce %|b{+-}2n=(12 {I2})%.

 17C  c  The authors studied the Coulomb dissociation of {+18}C to states in    
 17C 2c  {+17}C with the aim of gaining insight into the astrophysically

 17C 3c  impinged on a 2145 mg/cm{+2} lead target that was at the center of the 
 17C 4c  Crystal Ball |g-ray array. The momentum of the {+17}C breakup

 17C 6c  target position, magnetic analysis in the ALADiN dipole magnet and a   
 17C 7c  set of position sensitive Si detectors after the magnet. The reaction  
 17C 8c  neutrons were characterized using the position sensitive ToF wall and  
 17C 9c  LAND neutron arrays. The final reaction kinematics were analyzed by

 17C bc  with the kinematic groups. Finally, data on a 935 mg/cm{+2} carbon     
 17C cc  target permitted an estimate of the nuclear contributions so the

 17N  c  1988Mu08,1989Le16: {+18}C ions from fragmentation of {+86}Kr           
 17N 2c  (1988Mu08) and {+48}Ca (1989Le16) on a {+181}Ta                        
 17N 3c  target at GANIL were filtered with the LISE spectrometer and           
 17N 4c  implanted in a Si detector telescope. The telescope was surrounded by  
 17N 5c  a thin scintillator to detect |b-rays and a segmented                  
 17N 6c  NE102A 4|p neutron array (energy thresholds of 440 keV and 350 keV     
 17N 7c  for 1988Mu08 and 1989Le16, respectively).                              
 17N 8c  Following implantation of {+18}C in the telescope, the cyclotron       
 17N 9c  frequency was scrambled and the decay event was measured. Delayed      
 17N Ac  neutron emission probabilities of P{-n}=(25.0 {I45})% and (50 {I10})   
 17N Bc  were deduced, respectively.                                            
 17N  c  1991Re02: spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 17N 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 17N 3c  filter and transfered to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The           
 17N 4c  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
 17N 5c  nuclides. The ions were implanted in a Si detector, and identification 
 17N 6c  by standard techniques was implemented. The |b-delayed neutrons were   
 17N 7c  detected in a polyethylene moderated {+3}He counter; half-lives        
 17N 8c  and |b-delayed neutron probabilities were deduced from                 
 17N 9c  analysis of the number of implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the      
 17N Ac  rate of |b-delayed neutrons detected in the zero-threshold counter.    
 17N Bc  The |b-delayed neutron probability =(43.3 {I65})% was deduced.         
 17N  c  1991Pr03: a beam of {+18}C ions, produced by fragmenting a {+22}Ne beam
 17N 2c  on a Be and C target at GANIL, was purified in the LISE spectrometer   
 17N 3c  and implanted in a plastic scintillator. Decay events were recorded    
 17N 4c  via |b-detection in the scintillator and |g-ray measurements in a      
 17N 5c  HPGe detector. The decay lifetimes of the four strongest known {+18}C  
 17N 6c  |g-ray transitions {+18}C*(115,2614,880,472) were analyzed and the     
 17N 7c  {+18}C T{-1/2}=95 ms {I10} was deduced.                                
 17N  c  The authors aimed to resolve uncertainty in the                        
 17N 2c  |b{+-}0n and |b{+-}1n decay branches. The decay of {+18}C and {+18}N   
 17N 3c  were measured under identical experimental conditions; then, the ratio 
 17N 4c  of the intensity of the E|g=1982 keV, which is strongly populated      
 17N 5c  in {+18}N |b decay was analyzed to deduce the {+18}C |b-decay branch   
 17N 6c  that results in {+18}N population. %p{-|g}=81 {I5} was deduced; since  
 17N 7c  the only other decay path that is open is the |b{+-}1n decay to {+17}N 
 17N 8c  states, then %p{-n}=19 {I5} is deduced.                                
 17N  c  A total of 9 |g-ray transitions in {+18}N were identified along with   
 17N 2c  2 |g-ray transitions in {+17}N. The |g-ray intensities are presented   
 17N 3c  in two formats: first they are given in relative intensity normalized  
 17N 4c  to E|g=2614, the strongest transition. The measurement essentially     
 17N 5c  provided only the relative intensity of |g-ray transitions, hence there
 17N 6c  are no branching ratios correlated with, for example, per 100 decays.  
 17N 7c  The |g-ray data is further complicated by other experimental effects,  
 17N 8c  such as a close geometry has led to large summing corrections. In      
 17N 9c  addition a poor efficiency at low energies (coupled with a long-lived  
 17N Ac  first excited state) has led to large disagreement between feeding into
 17N Bc  the {+18}N*(115) level and |g-decay out of the level. In general there 
 17N Cc  appears to Be poor agreement between feeding into levels and decay     
 17N Dc  out of levels. It is difficult to judge the overall issue here         
 17N Ec  because the second and final presentation of |g-ray intensities is     
 17N Fc  for |g-decay out of each level normalized for the sum equal to 100.    
 17N Gc  In short there is no way to estimate the overall summing corrections   
 17N Hc  or to evaluate the intensity ballance for each state.                  
 17N  c  The authors also provide an estimate of the relative |b-decay feeding  
 17N 2c  into the {+18}N E{-x}=0, 115, 587, 1735 and 2614 keV levels of I|b=    
 17N 3c  0, 0, <1, 11 {I8} and 89 {I11%}. Using the |g-decay branching ratios   
 17N 4c  for each level, the relative |b-decay feeding and the P{-n} value it is
 17N 5c  possible to deduce a |b-decay scheme. However, because of the          
 17N 6c  issues above it is difficult to estimate the renormalization for the   
 17N 7c  |g-ray transitions for |g-decay in {+17}N. The E|g=879.7 keV transition
 17N 8c  between {+18}N*(2614 -->1735) is the strongest transition that has no  
 17N 9c  summing correction, so it seems most reasonable to scale with this.    
 17N  c  1995Sc03: a beam of {+18}C ions was produced by fragmenting a {+22}Ne  
 17N 2c  beam on a {+9}Be target. The beam was magnetically separated, degraded 
 17N 3c  to lower energies, and finally stopped in a plastic implantaion        
 17N 4c  scintillator detector. The beam carried a<4% {+20}N impurity.          
 17N 5c  The {+20}N ions were stopped in an absorber upstream of the            
 17N 6c  implantation detector, and no associated activity was observed.        
 17N 7c  The data were collected with a 206 ms beam-on/ 222 ms beam-off cycle.  
 17N  c  Neutrons were detected in one of 15 plastic scintallator bars that     
 17N 2c  formed an array surrounding the target with a 99.7 cm flight path.     
 17N 3c  The neutron energies were determined by ToF between the implantation   
 17N 4c  detector and the neutron array with E(n) energy threshold of 750 keV.  
 17N 5c  The ToF analysis permitted analysis of background events from          
 17N 6c  {+18}C decay daughters ({+18}N and {+17}N).                            
 17N 7c  Seven neutron energy groups were observed that are attributed to       
 17N 8c  {+18}C decay. The lack of neutron-|g coincidence data precludes the    
 17N 9c  assignment of any neutron groups to decays other than to the ground    
 17N Ac  state; hence, the analysis is carried out for this case. The intensity 
 17N Bc  of |b-delayed neutron decays was measured as %|b{+-}n=(21.4 {I44})%.   
 17N  c  Comments                                                               
 17N  c  The P{-n}=(43.3 {I65})% value is accepted, the relative |b-decay       
 17N 2c  feeding to {+18}N levels and |g-ray branching ratios given in 1991Pr03 
 17N 3c  are accepted and should Be normalized for %|b{+-}0n=66.7 {I65}.        
 17N 4c  Significant |b{+-}1n decay strength is not accounted for.              
 17N 5c  The P{-n}=(43.3 {I65})% value of (1991Re02) is significantly larger    
 17N 6c  than the other findings. The zero-energy threshold                     
 17N 7c  of (1991Re02) is significantly lower than implemented in the           
 17N 8c  other measurements, hence involvement of |b-decay to states            
 17N 9c  that decay with low-energy neutrons may play a role in the decay.      
 17N  c  There are no known {+18}N levels above the neutron separation          
 17N 2c  threshold, so, at the moment the neutron energy groups may only Be     
 17N 3c  associated with decay to the ground state. There is evidence for       
 17N 4c  neutron decay to states at or above {+17}N*(1374,1849) since those     
 17N 5c  |g-ray decay radiations are observed. The relative intensities of the  
 17N 6c  {+17}N*(1374,1849) |g-ray transitions are normalized to the strength of
 17N 7c  the E|g=879.7 keV transition between {+17}N*(2614 ->1735) as described 
 17N 8c  above.

 17O  c  Foreword:                                                              
 17O  c  The measurements of |b-delayed neutrons from {+17}N                    
 17O 2c  decay are relatively consistent in both the energies and relative      
 17O 3c  intensities of neutron groups. Most efforts did not determine the      
 17O 4c  absolute feeding intensities to neutron groups, but rather the         
 17O 5c  relative intensities of neutron groups are reported. The determination 
 17O 6c  of "absolute" intensities relies on a renormalization using an         
 17O 7c  assumption of %|b-n=100-(4.66 {I75}))=(95.34 {I75})%, where            
 17O 8c  4.66 {I75} is the feeding to neutron-bound states (1964Si06).          
 17O  c  1964Si06: {+17}N activity was produced in thin-walled cells comprised  
 17O 2c  of either aluminium or stainless steel using the {+15}N(t,p)           
 17O 3c  reaction. A NaI detector observed the |g-ray spectrum obtained         
 17O 4c  in measurements on the stainless steel cell; transitions at E{-|g}=    
 17O 5c  870 and 2190 keV were observed with a relative ratio=(6.8 {I9}):1.0.   
 17O 6c  Since the 2190 transition corresponds to a cascade from {+17}O*(3055)  
 17O 7c  to {+17}O*(870), the relative feeding of the first and second excited  
 17O 8c  states is (5.8 {I9}):1.0 . Care was taken to minimize contributions    
 17O 9c  from n+p capture that could interfere with the E{-|g}=2190 keV         
 17O ac  analysis. No other |g-rays were observed; in particular transitions    
 17O bc  from {+17}O*(3843:J{+|p}=5/2-) and transitions in {+16}O were not      
 17O cc  observed.                                                              
 17O  c  The measurements on the aluminium cell were analyzed to obtain the     
 17O 2c  singles |b-ray spectrum and the |b-ray plus |g-ray coincidence         
 17O 3c  spectrum. The part of the singles spectrum that extended above the     
 17O 4c  coincidence spectrum was analyzed to obtain the ratio of feeding to    
 17O 5c  {+17}O*(870) relative to feeding to the {+17}O{-g.s.}=(1.7 {I4}):1.0.  
 17O  c  Lastly, the beta spectrum was analyzed to determine the feeding |b-ray 
 17O 2c  intensity to {+17}O*(0,870,3055) relative to the total |b-ray          
 17O 3c  intensity. These decay branches correspond to (4.66 {I75})% of all     
 17O 4c  decays.                                                                
 17O  c  Hence the calculated branching fractions are                           
 17O 2c  (1.55 {I47})% to {+17}O{-g.s.},                                        
 17O 3c  (2.64 {I47})% to {+17}O*(870),                                         
 17O 4c  (0.460 {I11})% to {+17}O*(3055).                                       
 17O 5c  Furthermore, the lack of feeding to {+17}O*(3843:J{+|p}=5/2-) is       
 17O 6c  evidence for assigning J{+|p}=1/2- to {+17}N{-g.s.}.                   
 17O  c  1973De32: {+17}N ions were produced by bombarding 88% enriched {+14}C  
 17O 2c  target which was on a thick tungsten backing with 27-MeV |a-particles. 
 17O 3c  The neutrons were detected with a {+3}He filled proportional counter.  
 17O 4c  Three neutron groups at E{-n}=390 {I16}, 1190 {I30} and 1710 {I40} keV 
 17O 5c  emitted from {+17}O*(4.55,5.09,5.94 MeV) to {+16}O{-g.s.} with         
 17O 6c  branching ratios of 27% {I3}, 57% {I4} and 11% {I2}, respectively.     
 17O 7c  Relative neutron branching ratios are measured, which are normalized   
 17O 8c  to the accepted %|b-n rate of 95%. From the neutron counts in the      
 17O 9c  1.9-2.6 MeV region an upper limit, <0.4%, is set for the branches      
 17O ac  emitted from {+17}O*(6.1-6.8 MeV) to {+16}O{-g.s.}.                    
 17O  c  1973Po11: {+17}N |b{+-}-decay activity was produced by bombarding      
 17O 2c  enriched {+15}N{-2} gas (95-99% {+15}N) using a 2.9-MeV triton beam.   
 17O 3c  The beam was chopped and had 4 second activation and counting periods. 
 17O 4c  The |b activity was detected by a NE102 detector, the |g-decay         
 17O 5c  activity was detected via a 15.2 cm by 12.7 cm NaI detector. The       
 17O 6c  neutron activity was initially measured using a NE102 disk, though     
 17O 7c  issues with high backgrounds at low-energies led to additional         
 17O 8c  measurements using a {+3}He proportional counter. The |b-n and |b-|g   
 17O 9c  coincidences were measured; there is no mention of n-|g coincidences,  
 17O ac  therefore neutron decays are assumed to populate {+16}O{-g.s.}.        
 17O  c  Neutron peaks at 385 {I4}, 1163 {I14} and 1675 {I24} keV were observed 
 17O 2c  corresponding to decays from {+17}O*(4.55,5.38,5.94 MeV) to            
 17O 3c  {+16}O{-g.s.}, respectively. The relative ratios for decay branches    
 17O 4c  were determined, and then the absolute branching ratios were           
 17O 5c  determined by a self-consistent renormalization. The feeding to the    
 17O 6c  {+17}O{-g.s.} relative to {+17}O*(870) was taken from (1964Si06)       
 17O 7c  (=(1.7 {I4}):1.0); other ratios, relative to the E{-n}=1.16 MeV group  
 17O 8c  intensity, were determined. The absolute branching ratios were         
 17O 9c  determined as Branching=(1.7 {I5})% to {+17}O{-g.s.}, (2.9 {I5})% to   
 17O ac  {+17}O*(870), (0.54 {I8})% to {+17}O*(3060), (37.9% {I18}) to          
 17O bc  {+17}O*(4550), (51.1% {I15}) to {+17}O*(5380), and (5.8% {I6}) to      
 17O cc  {+17}O*(5940). The total feeding to bound {+17}O levels was found to   
 17O dc  be (5.14 {I72})%.                                                      
 17O  c  1976Al02: {+17}N ions were produced in the {+15}N(t,p) reaction by     
 17O 2c  bombarding a Ti{+15}N target with 3.0-MeV tritons. The target was      
 17O 3c  irradiated for 4 sec, followed by a 4 sec counting period.             
 17O  c  The |g-ray activity was measured using a Ge(Li) detector. Energies for 
 17O 2c  the {+17}O first and second excited states were determined as 870.8 keV
 17O 3c  {I2} and 3055.2 keV {I3}, and the ratio of the |g ray intensities was  
 17O 4c  measured as 1:(9.6 {I4}). This ratio is significanly different from    
 17O 5c  prior results and is attributed to the ability to resolve the          
 17O 6c  E{-|g}=2190 keV transition from the E{-|g}=2223 keV peak from thermal  
 17O 7c  neutron capture on hydrogen.  No attempt to measure the ground-state   
 17O 8c  branch was made, and hence the values for branching to {+17}O{-g.s.}   
 17O 9c  and {+17}O bound levels was taken from (1964Si06). The branching ratios
 17O ac  were found as (1.6 {I5})% to {+17}O{-g.s.}, (3.0 {I5})% to             
 17O bc  {+17}O*(870), (0.34 {I6})% to {+17}O*(3055).                           
 17O  c  Delayed neutrons were measured using a {+3}He neutron detector; peaks  
 17O 2c  at E{-n}=390, 1160 and 1690 keV were observed. Taking the sum of |b    
 17O 3c  branches to neutron-stable level in {+17}O as (4.9 {I7})%, the         
 17O 4c  branching ratios from {+17}O*(4.55,5.38,5.94 MeV) to {+16}O{-g.s.} are 
 17O 5c  found as 39.2% {I20}, 48.0% {I15} and 7.9% {I7}, respectively.         
 17O  c  1976Oh05: {+17}N |b-decay activity was produced via the                
 17O 2c  {+6}Li(n,|a){+3}H and {+18}O({+3}H,|a){+17}N reactions by              
 17O 3c  placing an enriched {+6}Li{-2}C{+18}O{-3} target (|> 95% {+6}Li, 93.4% 
 17O 4c  {+18}O) in a reactor and utilizing a fast pneumatic tube system to     
 17O 5c  transfer the sample between activation and counting stations. The      
 17O 6c  {+17}N neutron decay curve was measured with eight {+3}He proportional 
 17O 7c  counters surrounded by paraffin. Four peaks at E{-n}=382.8 {I9}, 884   
 17O 8c  {I21} (new identified), 1170.9 {I8} and 1700.3 {I17} keV were measured 
 17O 9c  with |G=54.8 {I4}, 113 {I55}, 63.2 {I11} and 60.5 {I32} keV,           
 17O ac  respectively. Normalization of the neutron emission probabilities to   
 17O bc  P{-n}=95% {I1} from (1964Si06), yields the |b{+-}n branching ratios    
 17O cc  from {+17}O*(4549.3 {I13},5081 {I21}, 5387.1 {12}, 5949.9 {I19} keV)   
 17O dc   to {+16}O{-g.s.} as, 34.8% {I26},                                     
 17O ec  0.6% {I4}, 52.7% {I35} and 7.0% {I5}, respectively.                    
 17O  c  In addition, T{-1/2}=4.174 s {I4} was measured.                        
 17O  c  1984In01: The neutron spectrum of activated cooling water from the     
 17O 2c  SLAC beam dump was analyzed using a {+3}He spectrometer. The activity  
 17O 3c  is presumably from the {+18}O(|g,p){+17}N reaction. In addition to     
 17O 4c  strong neutron lines at E{-n}=383, 1170 and 1700 keV a significantly   
 17O 5c  weaker group at E{-n}=2070 keV is suggested. This group has not been   
 17O 6c  reported in other work.                                                
 17O  c  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 17O 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 17O 3c  filter and transferred to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The          
 17O 4c  beamline was separately tuned to transport a number of different       
 17O 5c  nuclides. The neutrons were detected in a polyethylene moderate {+3}He 
 17O 6c  counter, and standard techniques were implemented. The |b-delayed      
 17O 7c  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
 17O 8c  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons    
 17O 9c  detected in the zero-threshold counter. The |b-delayed neutron         
 17O ac  probability P{-n}=(102.4 {I60})% was deduced.                          
 17O  c  1996Ra02,2003Mi01: In these experiments, authors observed              
 17O 2c  {+17}N(|b{+-}n) decay to calibrate the neutron energy and the neutron  
 17O 3c  counters. Neutron peaks at 380, 1170 and 1700 keV were observed.       
 17O 4c  The branching ratios of corresponding emissions from                   
 17O 5c  {+17}O*(4.55,5.38,5.94 MeV) to {+16}O{-g.s.} normalized to 95% {I1} are

 17O 4c  were obtained using the TONNERRE array which covered 45% of 4|p. The

 17O  c  For the population of bound {+17}O states, the |b-ray energy spectrum  
 17O 2c  analysis of (1964Si06) [Branching({+17}O*(0,870,3055)){-total}=(4.66   
 17O 3c  {I75}) and R=1:(1.7 {I4}) for |b-decay to {+17}O{-g.s.} vs decay to    
 17O 4c  {+17}O*(870)] are combined with R=(9.6 {I4}):1 for the relative        
 17O 5c  intensities of E{-|g}=870 and 2170 keV |g-rays from (1976Al02).        
 17O  c  The data on decay feedings to bound states in {+17}O is sparse;        
 17O 2c  measurements are found in (1964Si06,1973Po11,1976Al02). The only       
 17O 3c  complete measurement on the decay populating {+17}O bound states is    
 17O 4c  found in (1964Si06); along with studying the |g radiations with a NaI  
 17O 5c  detector, they analyzed the |b radiations. In (1964Si06) the ratio of  
 17O 6c  the |b-decay to {+17}O{-g.s.} relative to feeding of {+17}O*(870) is   
 17O 7c  determined as 1:(1.7 {I4}); there is no other comparible measurement.  
 17O 8c  Further analysis of the |b-ray spectrum determined that the bound      
 17O 9c  {+17}O*(0,870,3055) states are populated in (4.66 {I75})% of decays.   
 17O ac  In (1973Po11), use of the (1964Si06) ground state result, along with   
 17O bc  analysis of their NaI data results in finding the branching ratio to   
 17O cc  {+17}O*(0,870,3055) as (5.14 {I72})%, but, as mentioned below, it is   
 17O dc  suggested that the E{-|g}=2170 keV intensity is enlarged by a          
 17O ec  systematic error associated with contributions from n+p capture. In    
 17O fc  (1973Po11) one finds the only reported connection between any neutron  
 17O gc  group intensity and a |g-ray transition intensity:                     
 17O hc  I(|g{-870 keV})/I(E{-n}=1.16 MeV)=(0.0667 {I95}).                      
 17O ic  In (1976Al02) the value R=(9.6 {I4}):1 for the relative                
 17O jc  intensities of E{-|g}=870 and 2170 keV |g-rays is found; they suggest  
 17O kc  the results of (1964Si06,1973Po11) are unreliable because neither      
 17O lc  group could resolve n+p capture |g rays from the 2170 keV decay        
 17O mc  transition; in spite of great caution described in those works this    
 17O nc  uncertainty discounts their E{-|g}=2170 keV intensities.               
 17O  c                                                                         
 17O  c  In all cases, the neutron group branching ratios are based on          
 17O 2c  relative intensity measurements that are normalized to unity with      
 17O 3c  inclusion of feedings to {+17}O bound states.                          
 17O  c  There are discrepancies among the relative intensities reported in     
 17O 2c  (1973De32,1973Po11,1976Al02,1976Oh05,1996Ra02). In the present analysis
 17O 3c  all measurements are considered; the results of (1973De32) appear to   
 17O 4c  deviate significantly from other measurements and are excluded from    
 17O 5c  analysis. The mean intensities from the remaining four measurements are
 17O 6c  determined after normalizing each measurement to the strongest         
 17O 7c  decay transition. These intensities are then renormalized to yield     
 17O 7c  %|b-n=(100-(4.66 {I75}))=(95.34 {I75})%.

 17O  c  1967Dz01: Differential cross-section measurements for {+6}Li+{+12}C    
 17O 2c  reactions were presented in 100-keV steps between 2.4 and 8.5 MeV at   
 17O 3c  0|' and in 200-keV steps between 3.4 and 7.4 MeV at 40|'(lab). Outgoing
 17O 4c  particles cross sections, p{-0-3}, involving ground and first three    
 17O 5c  excited states of {+17}O were measured.                                
 17O  c  1968Me10: A positive-ion beam of {+6}Li at E{-lab}=20 MeV impinged on  
 17O 2c  a natural carbon target (130 |mg/cm{+2}) at the Tandem Van de Graaff   
 17O 3c  accelerator, Heidelberg. The reaction products were detected and       
 17O 4c  identified using detector telescopes and |DE-E method. The low-lying   
 17O 5c  states of {+17}O were not observed and the medium excitation range     
 17O 6c  were not resolved in this experiment. The proton angular distribution  
 17O 7c  could only be obtained for the {+17}O*(8.46 MeV; (7/2+)) excited state.
 17O  c  1970Jo09: An E({+6}Li)=5.6-14.0 MeV beam impinged on a self-supporting 
 17O 2c  carbon foils (evaporated from an arc onto Teepol-coated slides) with   
 17O 3c  thickness 10-52 |mg/cm{+2} at the University of Iowa HVEC Model |eN Van
 17O 4c  de Graaff accelerator. Cross sections were measured for protons,       
 17O 5c  deuterons, and |a particles at |q{-lab}=0|' and 40|' and angular       
 17O 6c  distributions were measured at various energies. Solid-state, |DE      
 17O 7c  and E detectors were used to detect and identify particles. The        
 17O 8c  absolute error of total cross sections is estimated to be |+15%. Energy
 17O 9c  levels of {+17}O*(0, 0.871, 3.058, 3.846 and 4.551 MeV) were observed. 
 17O  c  1980Ne05: A {+6}Li ion beam at E=156 MeV bombarded a 4.5 mg/cm{+2}     
 17O 2c  natural {+12}C target using the Karlsruhe Isochronous Cyclotron.       
 17O 3c  Charged particles were detected by a semiconductor telescope           
 17O 4c  consisteing of a |DE surface-barrier Si detector (0.3 mm) and two      
 17O 5c  germanium detectors (15 mm and 20 mm) with the energy resolution was   
 17O 6c  |?500 keV (FWHM). The solid angle covered was 4|*10{+-5} sr and the    
 17O 7c  angular resolution was |D|q|?0.2|'. The particles were identified by an
 17O 8c  off-line-procedure on the basis of the Goulding-method. The break-up   
 17O 9c  cross sections were measured.                                          
 17O  c  1982Ta23: {+12}C({+6}Li,p), E=36,32,28 MeV; measured yield vs          
 17O 2c  particle energy, |s(|q), fusion |s, breakup |s vs E; deduced reaction  
 17O 3c  mechanism. Optical, simple breakup model analyses.                     
 17O  c  1986Sm10: {+17}O energy levels were populated by bombardment of an E=28
 17O 2c  MeV ion beam of {+6}Li, from FN tandem accelerator at the University   
 17O 3c  of Pennsylvania, with a self-supporting carbon foils (50 |mg/cm{+2};   
 17O 4c  >99.5% {+12}C). The outgoing protons were momentum analyzed in a       
 17O 5c  multiangle spectrograph and detected in Ilford L4 nuclear emulsions in 
 17O 6c  the focal plane. A proton spectrum was measured at |q=15|' with        
 17O 7c  resolution FWHM|?45 keV. Most of the known {+17}O levels were          
 17O 8c  populated. See also (1985SmZZ).

 17O  c  1970Be31: The {+13}C({+6}Li,d) and {+13}C({+7}Li,t) reactions were     
 17O 2c  studied at the University of Pennsylvania tandem accelerator using     
 17O 3c  18-MeV {+6}Li and 17-MeV {+7}Li ion beams bombarding a self-supporting,
 17O 4c  60|+14 |mg/cm{+2} thick {+13}C target. Reaction deuterons and tritons  
 17O 5c  were momentum analyzed in a spectrograph over an angular range         
 17O 6c  |q=3.75|'-172.5|'. Fifteen energy                                      
 17O 7c  levels below E{-x}=8.5-MeV were deduced from the angular               
 17O 8c  distributions. Transitions to negative-parity states at                
 17O 9c  E{-x}=3.06, 3.85, and 4.55 MeV are the strongest when compared         
 17O ac  with those from the {+12}C({+7}Li,t) and {+12}C({+6}Li,d) reactions    
 17O bc  leading to the first K=0, {+16}O rotational band. Strong transitions   
 17O cc  were also observed at E{-x}=7.38, (8.46,8.49), (8.87,8.95), and        
 17O dc  (9.14,9.20) MeV.                                                       
 17O  c  1970Go29: Beam of {+6}Li/{+7}Li from the cyclotron of the              
 17O 2c  Kurchatov Atomic Energy institute at E=25.6 MeV/30.1 MeV impinged on a 
 17O 3c  self-supporting carbon foil (0.4 mg/cm{+2}, 75% {+13}C isotope         
 17O 4c  enriched). The reaction products were detected and identified with a   
 17O 5c  |DE/|DX-E counter telescope. The energy spectra were analyzed using a  
 17O 6c  multidimensional analyzer. The angular distributions of deutrons       
 17O 7c  were obtained at |q=0|'-45|'. States at                                
 17O 8c  {+17}O*(0,0.87,3.06,3.85,4.56,7.56,8.88 MeV) were observed. The group  
 17O 9c  of levels in the energy range E{-x}=5.0-6.4 MeV were masked by the     
 17O ac  {+12}C impurity in the target and not observed. The J{+|p} value of the
 17O bc  {+17}O*(7.56 MeV) state was determined as 9/2-. The hypothesis of the  
 17O cc  weak binding of the four particles in the sd shell and of several      
 17O dc  holes in the p shell is confirmed.

 17O 2c  enriched {+13}C target at the Florida State University accelerator     
 17O 3c  facility. An array of five 5 cm|*1 cm position sensitive Si            
 17O 4c  detectors measured {+16}O and deuterons from the reaction.             
 17O  c  Three broad groups, corresponding to {+17}O*(6356), {+17}O*(7165,7248) 
 17O 2c  and {+17}O*(7378,7381) are populated in the reaction. Data are         
 17O 3c  analyzed via an R-matrix analysis; the parameters of the higher-lying

 17O  c  1969De06: An E({+3}He)=16 MeV beam from the Heidelberg E(n) Tandem Van 
 17O 2c  de Graaff accelerator bombarded a target containing 10 |mg/cm{+2} of   
 17O 3c  {+18}O and |?6 |mg/cm{+2} of {+16}O. A broad range magnetic            
 17O 4c  spectrograph was used to analyze |a-particles. The |a-particle         
 17O 5c  spectrum was obtained at |q=5|' and the absolute cross sections were   
 17O 6c  determined with an accuracy of 25%. Eight analogue T=3/2 excited       
 17O 7c  states in {+17}O were identified. The {Il}-transfer values and         
 17O 8c  spectroscopic factors were also deduced for four of these states.      
 17O  c  1970Mc02: Branching ratios were measured for the decays of the lowest  
 17O 2c  T=3/2 levels of {+17}F and {+17}O to the ground state and unresolved   
 17O 3c  6.05- and 6.13-MeV levels of {+16}O. The experiment was performed by   
 17O 4c  bombarding a nickel oxide target (98% {+18}O enriched) with an E=12    
 17O 5c  {+3}He ion beam. Alpha particles were detected at |q=10|' with a       
 17O 6c  double-focusing magnetic spectrometer.

 17O  c  1991Re02: Spallation products from 800 MeV proton bombardment of a     
 17O 2c  {+232}Th target were captured by a transport line with a mass-to-charge
 17O 3c  filter and transfered to the TOFI spectrometer at LAMPF. The beam line 
 17O 4c  was separately tuned to transport a number of different nuclides. The  
 17O 5c  ions were implanted in a Si detector, and identification by standard   
 17O 6c  techniques was implemented. The |b-delayed neutrons were detected in a 
 17O 7c  polyethylene moderated {+3}He counter; half-lives and |b-delayed       
 17O 8c  neutron probabilities were deduced from analysis of the number of      
 17O 9c  implanted ions (per beam pulse) and the rate of |b-delayed neutrons    
 17O ac  detected in the zero-threshold counter. The |b-delayed neutron         
 17O bc  probability =14.3% {I20} was deduced along with T{-1/2}=790 ms {I210}. 
 17O  c  A reanalysis of the 1991Re02 data, with additional data was published  
 17O 2c  in (1994ReZZ).  The reanalysis indicates P{-n}=(12.0 {I13})% and       
 17O 3c  T{-1/2}=658 ms {I44}. (Other unpublished reanalyses are found in       
 17O 4c  1995ReZZ, 2008ReZZ).

 17O  c  1994Sc01: A Be target was bombarded by a 75 MeV/A {+22}Ne beam         
 17O 2c  to produce {+18}N ions that were selected and stopped in a thin plastic
 17O 3c  detector. The implantation detector was surrounded by 15 large area    
 17O 4c  neutron detectors that covered 14.3% of 4|p, and neutron energies      
 17O 5c  were determined by time-of-flight between the implantation foil and    
 17O 6c  the neutron array.                                                     
 17O  c  The lifetime T{-1/2}=624 ms {I12} was measured. Nine neutron groups    
 17O 2c  with energies (branching ratios) of E{-n}=0.99 MeV {I3} (0.16 {I3})%,  
 17O 3c  1.16 MeV {I2} (0.39 {I9})%, 1.35 MeV {I2} (0.47 {I9})%, 1.55 MeV {I2}  
 17O 4c  (0.14 {I3})%, 1.77 MeV {I2} (0.17 {I3})%, 2.07 MeV {I3} (0.16 {I3})%,  
 17O 5c  2.46 MeV {I3} (0.43 {I9})%, 2.78 MeV {I3} (0.13 {I3})% and 3.26 MeV    
 17O 6c  {I3} (0.19 {I4})% were observed in the ToF spectrum. The total observed
 17O 7c  branching ratio (Branching) to neutron unbound levels is 2.2% {I4}.    
 17O  c  2005Li60: A thick Be target was bombarded by a 68.8 MeV/A {+22}Ne beam 
 17O 2c  to produce {+18}N ions that were selected and stopped in a thin plastic
 17O 3c  scintillation detector. Two different plastic scintillator arrays      
 17O 4c  (neutron walls) were used to detect delayed neutrons with coverage of  
 17O 5c  30% and 2.2% of 4|p sr for high energy and low energy, respectively.   
 17O 6c  The neutron detection efficiecies were calibrated with the known       
 17O 7c  {+17}N |b{+-}n decay neutron spectrum. A set of 3 HPGe detectors       
 17O 8c  were positioned around the target to measure |g-ray emissions.         
 17O  c  Beam was collected in the target for cycles of 2.0 s activation        
 17O 2c  periods followed by 2.0 s counting periods. The result                 
 17O 3c  T{-1/2}=619 ms {I2} was obtained from analysis of the |b-ray decay     
 17O 4c  curve observed in the thin plastic catcher foil; a small 5%            
 17O 5c  {+20}O (T{-1/2}=13.5 s) component was the main active beam contaminant.
 17O 6c  An exclusive gate on the on the strongest neutron peak at E{-n}=       
 17O 7c  0.58 MeV yielded the value T{-1/2}=610 ms {I23}.                       
 17O  c  Analysis of the ToF spectrum indicates decays of 11 neutron emitting   
 17O 2c  states in {+18}O with E{-n} (branching ratio)=0.58 MeV {I2}

 17O 6c  2.44 MeV {I4} (0.43 {I6})%, 2.70 MeV {I4} (0.13 {I2})% and 3.22 MeV    
 17O 7c  {I5} (0.23 {I3})%. The total observed Branching is 6.98% {I146}. The   
 17O 8c  |b-delayed |g-ray emissions were briefly discussed, though there is no 
 17O 9c  mention of any transitions observed in {+17}O; it is assumed that none 
 17O ac  are observed.                                                          
 17O  c  2007Lo05: A Be target was bombarded by a 68.8 MeV/A {+22}Ne beam       
 17O 2c  to produce {+18}N ions that were selected and stopped in a thin plastic
 17O 3c  scintillation detector. A neutron sphere composed of eight identical   
 17O 4c  plastic scintillator counters was used to detect delayed neutrons; each
 17O 5c  segment covered 3.75% of 4|p sr.                                       
 17O  c  Three T{-1/2} values were obtained by gating the |b-time spectrum      
 17O 2c  corresponding to various neutron peaks, 625 ms {I30}, 635 ms {I40} and 
 17O 3c  609 ms {I60}. In this measurement, the emphasis was on fast neutrons.  
 17O 4c  Nine neutron peaks were observed, eight are in good agreement with     
 17O 5c  2005Li60. Peaks are observed at  E{-n}=1.13 MeV {I3}, 1.35 MeV {I3},   
 17O 6c  1.58 MeV {I3}, 1.79 MeV {I3}, 2.05 MeV {I3}, 2.43 MeV {I4}, 2.76 MeV   
 17O 7c  {I4}, 3.22 MeV {I4} and 3.78 MeV {I5} (0.05 {I3})%. A new peak at      
 17O 8c  E{-n}(lab)=3.78 MeV {I5} was identified. The detection efficiency for  
 17O 9c  groups with E{-n} < 2.0 MeV was low, and therefore the proceedure for  
 17O ac  fitting of these peaks relied on prior analysis. The total observed    
 17O bc  |b-delayed Branching is 7.03% {I146}.                                  
 17O  c  In this experiment, the calibration using {+17}N provided the          
 17O 2c  neutron detection efficiency up to 1.73 MeV, the authors used the      
 17O 3c  efficiency curve obtained in 2005Li60 (efficiency up to 3.22 MeV) to   
 17O 4c  determine the absolute Branching of this new peak. The Branching of    
 17O 5c  0.05% {I3} corresponding to E{-x}({+18}O)=12.05 MeV {I5} and log       
 17O 6c  {Ift}=5.24 {I3} was deduced. This new state was also observed by       
 17O 7c  1995Se02 in an electron scattering experiment, who found the J{+|p}=1- 
 17O 8c  or 2+. The present authors concluded J{+|p}=1-.                        
 17O  c  Comments:                                                              
 17O  c  P{-n}=12.0% {I13} is reported in the reanalysis of 1991Re02. Results   
 17O 2c  reported in (2005Li60, 2007Lo05) can account for only (7.03 {I146})%;  
 17O 3c  the missing strength of |?5% is attributed to one or several states in 
 17O 4c  {+18}O with 8.044 MeV |<E{-x}|<8.50 MeV, where the corresponding       
 17O 5c  neutron group's emission energy is below the threshold of the neutron  
 17O 6c  detector systems.                                                      
 17O  c  No evidence was found for population of a broad state at E{-x}|?9 MeV  
 17O 2c  (suggested by 1989Zh04 in |b-delayed |a-emission); In 1994Sc01 an      
 17O 3c  upper limit for its Branching of |<1% was deduced from the total       
 17O 4c  number of counts in the relevant energy range. Comparing with          
 17O 5c  1989Zh04, it can be concluded that most of the observed width          
 17O 6c  corresponds to the |G{-|a} of this state.                              
 17O  c  In 1994Sc01, neutron groups with a total Branching of 2.2% {I4} were   
 17O 2c  observed; a comparison with those same groups observed in              
 17O 3c  2005Li60 yields a slightly lower Branching of 1.66% {I28}. The         
 17O 4c  analysis of 2005Li60, which finds a total %|b{+-}n intensity of (7.0   
 17O 5c  {I15})%, may be limited by an insensitivity to low energy neutrons. In 
 17O 6c  addition 2007Lo05 taylored their sensitivity                           
 17O 7c  to fast neutron groups, which were difficult to resolve, and a new     
 17O 8c  transition in the |b-delayed neutron decay is observed. No neutron     
 17O 9c  peaks between 3.78 and 5.5 MeV were observed.

 17O 6c  information. The overall resolutions for deutrons was about 90 keV.    
 17O  c  The integrated cross sections |s{-int} were measured in both reactions.
 17O 2c  Spin assignments were extracted from |s{-int} in the reaction          
 17O 3c  {+12}C({+7}li,d) and a modified DWBA code was used to analyze the      
 17O 4c  reaction {+13}C({+7}Li,t). Energy levels and J{+|p} values of {+17}O   
 17O 5c  were deduced.                                                          
 17O  c  1978Cl08: Ion beams of {+6}Li or {+7}Li at E=34, 36 MeV, produced at   
 17O 2c  the Florida State University/FN tandem Van de Graaff accelerator,      
 17O 3c  impinged on 100 |mg/cm{+2} thick {+13}C targets (enriched 99%). A      
 17O 4c  telescope consisting of a |DE and a Si(Li)E detector was used to       
 17O 5c  detect particles with a subtended angle |q=0.2|' with resolution 85 keV
 17O 6c  for tritons and 75 keV for deuterons. Angular distributions were       
 17O 7c  measured at |q=5.0|'-31.5|'. Strongly populated excited levels of      
 17O 8c  {+17}O*(13.58 {I2}: suggested J{+|p}=11/2- or 13/2- or                 
 17O 9c  both,14.86,18.17,19.24 MeV) were observed.                             
 17O  c  1982Ta23: {+13}C({+7}Li,t), E=36,32,28 MeV; measured yield vs particle

 17O 3c  Optical, simple breakup model analyses.                                
 17O  c  2008Pe09: The {+13}C(|a,n){+16}O reaction was investigated through the 
 17O 2c  direct |a transfer reaction {+13}C({+7}Li,t). The experiment was       
 17O 3c  performed at the Orsay Tandem using a {+7}Li{+3+} beam at E=28, 35 MeV 
 17O 4c  to bombard a self-supporting, 90% enriched {+13}C target (72(4)        
 17O 5c  or 133(7) |mg/cm{+2}). The reaction products were analyzed with an     
 17O 6c  Enge split-pole spectrometer and detected and identified by a          
 17O 7c  position-sensitive gas chamber and a |DE proportional gas counter. The 
 17O 8c  tritons were detected at |q=0|'-31|'. Differential cross sections of   
 17O 9c  {+17}O*(3.055,4.55,6.356,7.37 MeV) states were measured and comapred   
 17O ac  with finite-range DWBA calculations. The spectroscopic factor, ANC     
 17O bc  (asymptotic normalization factor) and the |a width of                  
 17O cc  {+17}O*(6.356 MeV:1/2+) subthreshold state were deduced using DWBA     
 17O dc  analysis. The result confirms that the contribution of the 1/2+ state  
 17O ec  is dominant at astropysical energies. See also (2007PeZZ).             
 17O  c  2020Me09: The authors analyzed {+17}O states populated in the          
 17O 2c  {+13}C({+7}Li,t) reaction to evaluate the {+17}F analog                
 17O 2c  states that may influence stellar {+13}N(|a,p) reaction rates.         
 17O  c  A beam of 34 MeV {+7}Li ions, from the Tandem-ALTO facility at Orsay,  
 17O 2c  impinged on a 90% {+13}C enriched 80 |mg/cm{+2} carbon target. Tritons 
 17O 3c  from reactions in the target were momentum analyzed for                
 17O 4c  |q{-lab.}=0|'-33|' using an Enge Split-Pole spectrometer. Angular      
 17O 5c  distributions were analyzed via finite-range DWBA for states           
 17O 6c  within E{-x}=5.6-7.7 MeV.                                              
 17O  c  Spectroscopic factors and |G{-|a} widths were deduced. Using this      
 17O 2c  information the analog states in {+17}F are evaluated and the          
 17O 3c  {+13}N(|a,p){+16}O astrophysical reaction rate is obtained using the   
 17O 4c  AZURE2 R-matrix code and found within a factor of two in comparison    
 17O 5c  of previous estimates. Resonances at E{-c.m.}(|a)=221, 741 and 959 keV 
 17O 6c  ({+17}F*(6039,6560,6778 keV)) are found to contribute the most         
 17O 7c  uncertainty to the reaction rate.

 17O 5c  {I6} |mg/cm{+2}, 8% purity). The reaction products were separated by a

 17O 2c  coupled-channels Born approximation (CCBA) calculations. The |a        
 17O 3c  spectroscopic factors of the {+17}O states were determined. The        
 17O 4c  largest value was for the subthreshold 1/2+ state at E{-x}=6.356 MeV,

 17O 2c  at E({+3}He)=2.1 and 2.8 MeV, corresponding to {+17}O*(20.5,21.1 MeV). 
 17O  c  1970Ho08: The {+14}C({+3}He,n) reaction was investigated using neutron 
 17O 2c  time-of-flight spectrometry by bombarding a {+14}C target with         
 17O 3c  E({+3}He)=3.5-6 MeV beams at the University of Alberta/Van de Graaff   
 17O 4c  facility. DWBA calculations were used to analyze angular               
 17O 5c  distributions. Energy levels at {+16}O*(0, 6.05+6.13, 6.92+7.12 MeV)

 17O 6c  detector that was 60% efficient relative to a 3 inch|*3 inch NaI

 17O 2c  (Cf{-2}) target with a beam of 30.5 MeV protons from the University of 
 17O 3c  Southern California linear accelerator. Charged particles were detected
 17O 4c  by a counter telescope consisting of 2 Si surfacs-barrier              
 17O 5c  detectors and were identified by the E-|DE method. Abosolute

 17F  c  1963Ba63: A variety of targets were bombarded by a 97 MeV proton beam  
 17F 2c  from the McGill synchrocyclotron. The results on {+17}Ne were obtained 
 17F 3c  by comparing the delayed protons emitted following bombardment of NaF  
 17F 4c  and LiF targets. Proton groups with E{-p}|?3.6 and 4.6 were measured   
 17F 5c  using a silicon detector telescope and were attributed to |b-delayed   
 17F 6c  proton decay from {+17}Ne. The lifetime was longer than the 2.5 ms     
 17F 7c  period between cyclotron beam bursts.                                  
 17F  c  1964Da13: A beam of 120 MeV {+12}C ions, from the Yale heavy ion       
 17F 2c  accelerator, bombarded either a |?12 mg/cm{+2} {+9}Be target or a      
 17F 4c  |?12 mg/cm{+2} {+12}C target. Reaction products, produced in the       
 17F 5c  target, were studied using a Si surface barrier detector for charged   
 17F 6c  particles, a thick plastic scintallator for |b{++} particles and       
 17F 7c  a 3 inch|*3 inch NaI(Tl) crystal to detect |g rays.                    
 17F  c  Proton groups with E{-p}=2.3, 3.8, 4.55, 4.9 and 5.1 MeV               
 17F 2c  are attributed to |b-delayed proton emission from {+17}Ne.             
 17F 3c  The life-time T=690 ms 30 is deduced; the discrepancy with the         
 17F 4c  accepted value is not understood.                                      
 17F  c  1963Ka36,1964Fl03: A beam of 140 MeV {+20}Ne ions, from the JINR       
 17F 2c  cyclotron, bombarded a 10 |mm thick {+nat}Ni target that was upstream  
 17F 3c  of a rotating aluminum disk. The reaction products escaping from the   
 17F 4c  target were implanted in the disk and transported to a counter         
 17F 5c  telescope comprising a thin aluminum absorber, a gas proportional      
 17F 6c  counter and two Si surface barrier detectors. An E|?5 MeV proton group 
 17F 7c  was observed in the |b-delayed particles emitted from reaction         
 17F 8c  products. The activity was also produced in {+20}Ne bombardment of     
 17F 9c  tantalum, copper and aluminum targets, indicating the activity results 
 17F ac  from a multi-nucleon transfer on {+20}Ne; {+17}Ne or {+20,21}Mg were   
 17F bc  most favored. Analysis of the decay curve indicated T{-1/2}=85 ms      
 17F cc  {I15}.                                                                 
 17F  c  1964Mc16: An activation target assembly was mounted on a probe that    
 17F 2c  could be inserted into the McGill synchrocyclotron. Various targets    
 17F 3c  containing LiF or Cf{-2} (teflon) were inserted into the cyclotron     
 17F 4c  for proton bombardment at E{-p}=40 to 80 MeV. The cyclotron was        
 17F 5c  operated in a mode to provide an activation period, a beam             
 17F 6c  dissipation period of 100 ms and a |?500 ms counting period. Three     
 17F 7c  proton groups at E{-p}=4.10, 4.92 and 5.40 are consistent with         
 17F 8c  |b-delayed proton emission. The different target compositions yielded  
 17F 9c  different lifetime results, suggesting some diffusion from the target. 
 17F ac  A half-life of T=102 ms {I7} is measured, though 103 ms {I7} is        
 17F bc  arbitrarily suggested to account for neon diffusion from the target.   
 17F ec  Analysis of the excitation function indicates a reaction threshold     
 17F fc  of 36.6 MeV {I3}.                                                      
 17F  c  1965Ha20: In this follow-up of (1964Mc16) additional statistics were   
 17F 2c  obtained and further analysis was carried out on {+17}F levels fed in  
 17F 3c  the decay of {+17}Ne. See also (1966Ha22,1966Ma12).                    
 17F  c  1967Es02: Beams of 26 to 32 MeV {+3}He ions, from the Brookhaven 60    
 17F 2c  inch cyclotron, impinged on either a gaseous O{-2} or thin Al{-2}O{-3} 
 17F 3c  target producing {+17}Ne residuals. An array of two Si detector        
 17F 4c  telescopes were used to measure the energy spectrum of |b-delayed      
 17F 5c  particle emissions. Ten groups were observed in the energy spectrum.   
 17F 6c  The target was irradiated for periods of 300 ms, while counting lasted 
 17F 7c  for 500 ms. Analysis of the decay curve yielded T=105 ms {I5}. A       
 17F 8c  careful study of the excitation function for the reaction indicated    
 17F 9c  Q=-22.42 MeV {I19} for the ({+3}He,2n) reaction, which corresponds to  
 17F ac  |DM=14.52 MeV {I19} using the 1964 mass tables.                        
 17F  c  1971Ha05: A beam of {+3}He ions from the Berkeley/88-inch produced     
 17F 2c  {+17}He nuclides, via the {+16}O({+3}He,2n) reaction. The {+17}Ne      
 17F 3c  nuclides were transported to a counting cell where |b-delayed protons  
 17F 4c  were detected using a |DE-E telescope; a NaI(Tl) |g-ray detector was   
 17F 5c  also employed to clarify proton feedings to {+16}O levels. A total of  
 17F 6c  17 proton groups to {+16}O*(0,6.05,6.13,6.92,7.11) were observed. The  
 17F 7c  half-life T{-1/2}=109.0 ms {I10} was also measured.                    
 17F  c  See also (1989Re02).                                                   
 17F  c  1988Bo39: A beam of {+17}Ne ions was produced at the CERN/ISOLDE       
 17F 2c  facility using proton spallation reactions on a MgO target. Neon ions  
 17F 3c  from the target were collected, post-accelerated to 60 keV and         
 17F 4c  magnetically separated to obtain the {+17}Ne beam, which was implanted 
 17F 5c  in a 50 |mg/cm{+2} carbon foil. An annular plastic scintillator        
 17F 6c  detector was placed on the upstream side of the target (w.r.t. beam)   
 17F 7c  while a series of different |DE Si surface-barrier detectors (covering 
 17F 8c  |?0.2% of 4|p) were separately placed on the downstream side of the    
 17F 9c  target. The Si detectors ranged had thicknesses of 10, 15, 27 and 1000 
 17F ac  |mm and were used to characterize the proton and |a groups the delayed 
 17F bc  particle spectrum. Twenty-eight different groups of |b-delayed protons 
 17F cc  and |as were identified. The lifetime was measured by collecting       
 17F dc  {+17}Ne ions for 0.2 s and counting for 1.0 s. The value T=109.3 ms    
 17F ec  {I6} was obtained. See other results on decay to {+17}F in             
 17F fc  (1993Bo36,1993RiZY).                                                   
 17F  c  1996OzZZ,1997OzZZ,1998Oz01: Beams of |?32 and 49 MeV/nucleon {+17}Ne   
 17F 2c  ions were produced by fragmenting a {+20}Ne beam at the RIKEN/RIPS     
 17F 3c  fragment separator. The {+17}Ne ions were counted as they were         
 17F 4c  implanted into a plastic plate beam stop. A high {+15}O contamination  
 17F 5c  was also present. The experiment was focused on                        
 17F 6c  determining the branching ratio for first forbidden |b feeding to      
 17F 7c  {+17}F*(495). Detectors included a plastic telescope for |b counting,  
 17F 8c  and two HPGe detectors. The T{-1/2}=108.3 ms {I31} and                 
 17F 9c  I|b({+17}F*(495))=(1.56 {I20})% were deduced in the analysis.          
 17F  c  2004Ba12: A beam of 260 keV {+17}Ne ions, produced in spallation       
 17F 2c  reactions of protons on a MgO target at the CERN/REX ISOLDE facility,  
 17F 3c  was polarized via the tilted foil technique and implanted in a Pt      
 17F 4c  stopper foil. The induced polarization was 2-3%. Analysis of the |b    
 17F 5c  asymmetry, mainly to {+17}F*(4700,5520), indicated |m=0.74 {I3}.       
 17F  c  1997Ki19,1998Ch05,2002Ch61,2002Mo19: A series of experiments on        
 17F 2c  {+17}Ne decay were carried out at the TRIUMF/TISOL facility. The aim   
 17F 3c  of the measurements was to exploit the {+17}Ne(|bp) reaction as a      
 17F 4c  means to populate astrophysically important states in {+16}O. Proton   
 17F 5c  spallation of a MgO target resulted in {+17}Ne ions that were          
 17F 6c  implanted on a collection tape that was positioned at the center of    
 17F 7c  various counting station configurations.                               
 17F  c  1998Ch05: A set of four |DE-E telescopes were used to

 17F 4c  a total of 11 decay branches were observed for the decay of            
 17F 5c  {+17}F*(11193 keV).                                                    
 17F  c  2002Ch61: The configuration of (1998Ch05) was improved by              
 17F 2c  implementing double-sided Si strip detectors into parts of the         
 17F 3c  counting station; this lowered the pile-up and random                  
 17F 4c  coincidence rates. It is noted that the reported branching ratios      
 17F 5c  show a significant systematic dependence on the                        
 17F 6c  detector configuration.                                                
 17F  c  2002Mo19: {+17}Ne |b delayed particle emission was studied using four  
 17F 2c  different experimental techniques: proton-|g coincidences, proton-|g   
 17F 3c  angular correlations, ToF spectra for the proton and |a particle       
 17F 4c  spectra, and a ratio cut for a clean |a spectrum.                      
 17F 5c  Proton-|g coincidences were determined using a beam of {+17}Ne ions at 
 17F 6c  the TISOL facility at TRIUMF. The beam traveled through a              
 17F 7c  four-sector annular silicon detector and onto a collection tape        
 17F 8c  directly in front of a plastic scintillator and a HPGe detector that   
 17F 9c  was not in the vacuum system. Counting rates were very high so only    
 17F ac  |g-ray events with energy above 4 MeV were accepted. A particle-|b     
 17F bc  coincidence spectrum was also recorded by the silicon detector.        
 17F  c  Proton-|g angular correlations were studied using two HPGe |g-ray      
 17F 2c  detectors and four ion-implanted silicon detectors surrounding a carbon
 17F 3c  collector foil. Angular correlations between emitted protons and {+16}O
 17F 4c  |g rays were measured. Using this method, J{+|p} was determined for    
 17F 5c  states in {+17}F.                                                      
 17F  c  ToF spectra were determined for proton and |a particle emissions.      
 17F 2c  A beam of {+17}Ne ions passed through a  carbon collector foil that was
 17F 3c  positioned at an angle and centered between to scitillation paddles,   
 17F 4c  the beam then passed into a SSB detector. Time and pulse-height        
 17F 5c  information were recorded. A clean |a spectrum was not able to be      
 17F 6c  produced because |b-proton coincidences at low energies were very      
 17F 7c  strong and obscured the weaker |a decay peaks. Therefore, the ratio cut
 17F 8c  technique was used to get a cleaner spectrum.                          
 17F  c  A thin SSB detector was placed on the opposite side of a               
 17F 2c  collector foil and a PIPS detector. Each detector had a thicker        
 17F 3c  detector behind it in order to reject background events due to         
 17F 4c  electrons and high energy protons. The PIPS detector recorded particle 
 17F 5c  recoil and the SSB detector recorded coincident |a particles.          
 17F 6c  Additional background events were removed using the ratio-cut          
 17F 7c  technique.                                                             
 17F  c  Using these methods, relative proton and |a branching ratios           
 17F 2c  were determined along with branching ratios for the |b decay of        
 17F 3c  {+17}Ne. Using these branching ratios, reduced Gammow-Teller matrix    
 17F 4c  elementes determined. |b-delayed proton decay to |a-unbound states in  
 17F 5c  {+16}O was also examined because of its relevance to astrophysics      
 17F 6c  (helium-burning stage of stellar evolution).                           
 17F  c  The values %|bp=95.4 {I46} and %|b|a=2.77 {I19} are deduced

 17NE c  In addition, 158 CsI(Na) crystals from the CAESAR array covered polar

 17NE c  2004Ze05: The two-proton decay of excited {+17}Ne states was studied   
 17NE2c  by analyzing the decay of states populated in 1-neutron removal        
 17NE3c  reactions from {+18}Ne. The 36 MeV/nucleon {+18}Ne beam was produced   
 17NE4c  at the GANIL/SISSI-|a facility by fragmenting a {+24}Mg beam on        
 17NE5c  a {+12}C production target. The incident trajectories of               
 17NE6c  {+18}Ne ions were traced as they impinged on a 47 mg/cm{+2} Be         
 17NE7c  foil placed at te SPEG spectrometer target position. Unbound {+17}Ne   
 17NE8c  states decayed by 2-proton emission to {+15}O+2p. The momenta          
 17NE9c  of protons were determined using the eight telescope MUST array, that  
 17NEac  covered |q{-lab}|?2|'-25|'. The heavier {+15}O recoils were momentum

 17NE2c  a variety of targets were bombarded by a 97 MeV proton beam from       
 17NE3c  the McGill synchrocyclotron. The results on {+17}Ne were obtained      
 17NE4c  by comparing the delayed protons emitted following bombardment of      
 17NE5c  NaF and LiF targets. Proton groups with E{-p}|?3.6 and 4.6 were        
 17NE6c  measured using a silicon detector telescope and                        
 17NE7c  were attributed to |b-delayed proton decay from {+17}Ne.               
 17NE8c  The lifetime was longer than the 2.5 ms period between cyclotron       
 17NE9c  beam bursts.

 17NE6c  in a mode to provide an activation period, a beam dissipation          
 17NE7c  period of 100 ms and a |?500 ms counting period.                       
 17NE8c  Three proton groups at E{-p}=4.10, 4.92 and 5.40 are consistent        
 17NE9c  with |b-delayed proton emission. The different target compositions     
 17NEac  yielded different lifetime results, suggesting some diffusion from     
 17NEbc  the target. A half-life of T=102 ms {I7} is measured, though

 17NE8c  addition, the |g rays from reactions in the target were detected

 17NE c  Events with {+15}O+p+p particles in coincidence were analyzed to

 17NE3c  to unbound {+17}Ne states are observed in the polyethylene and carbon  
 17NE4c  target data, while only three states are observed in the lead target   
 17NE5c  data. The lowest peak apparently corresponds to an unresolved doublet, 
 17NE6c  first reported by (1998Gu10). The second peak agrees well in excitation
 17NE7c  energy with the J{+|p}=5/2+ 2651 keV {I12} state, also reported by     
 17NE8c  (1998Gu10); however because this region is populated in both Coulomb   
 17NE9c  and nuclear mechanisms, it is suggested that a 5/2+ and 3/2-           
 17NEac  doublet is present in this region.

 17NA4c  excitations in the core are taken into account and predictions are made
 17NA5c  for the low-energy levels of {+17}Na.                                  
 17NA c  2012Am06: The authors evaluate three approaches for predicting the     
 17NA2c  ground state mass: use of mass formulae based on analysis of isobar

 17NA4c  systematic evaluation of mass values and excited state energy trends   
 17NA5c  in nearby nuclides. Predicted ground-state energies, rangeing from 1

 17NA2c  three levels of {+17}Na are obtained based on a {+17}Na model where    
 17NA3c  wave function amplitudes are based on those of the bound {+17}C states.
 17NA4c  The wavefunctions are developed by coupling either a {Is}- or          
 17NA5c  {Id}-wave nucleon with A=16 states whose energies are computed in a    
 17NA7c  core plus two-nucleon space based on the known {+16}C levels. Level    
 17NA8c  energies, relative to the p+{+16}Ne threshold, and partial widths for  
 17NA9c  decay to either the ground or first excited state of {+16}Ne are given 
 17NAac  and compared with results from (2010Ti02). In 2014Fo23, the shell-model
 17NAbc  is updated results are compared with the prior literature. In          
 17NAcc  2017Fo18, a potential model utilizing the earlier shell model results  
 17NAdc  is used to estimate the partial widths for the proton decay of {+17}Na 
 17NAec  to {+16}Ne states.

 17NA c  The authors report the first evidence for a                            
 17NA2c  resonant structure in {+17}Na. They also reported on                   
 17NA3c  a variety of one- and two-proton unbound levels in other nuclides that 
 17NA4c  were populated in the bombardment of a {+9}Be target by either a 68    
 17NA5c  MeV/nucleon {+9}C beam or a 58 MeV/nucleon {+17}Ne beam. The reactions 
 17NA6c  produced short-lived levels that proton decayed before exiting the     
 17NA7c  target.                                                                
 17NA c  In this case, a {+17}Ne beam was produced at the NSCL by               
 17NA2c  fragmenting a {+20}Ne beam in the A1900 beam separator. The {+17}Ne    
 17NA3c  beam impinged on a 1 mm thick {+9}Be target, which populated {+17}Na   
 17NA4c  states, presumably by charge-exchange reactions. The {+17}Na states    
 17NA5c  quickly decayed via proton emission.                                   
 17NA c  The complete kinematics of the charged-particle reaction products were 
 17NA2c  measured using the HiRA array, which comprised a set of 14             
 17NA3c  64 mm |* 64 mm                                                         
 17NA4c  position sensitive |DE-E telescopes that covered the forward direction 
 17NA5c  of the outgoing beam (|q{-lab}|?2|' to 13.9|'). The telescopes were    
 17NA6c  arranged in verticle towers with a 2-3-4-3-2 configuration where the   
 17NA7c  central tower had a gap between the upper and lower two telescopes to  
 17NA8c  permit the beam a downstream exit at |q=0|'.                           
 17NA c  In addition, 158 CsI(Na) crystals from the CAESAR array covered polar  
 17NA2c  angles between |q{-lab}=57.5|' and 142.4|' and measured the coincident 
 17NA3c  |g-ray deexcitations.                                                  
 17NA c  A peak with |G|?1150 keV was observed in the invariant                 
 17NA2c  mass spectrum at E(3p+{+14}O){-rel}=4.85 MeV {I6} . The spectrum also  
 17NA3c  shows an excess of counts near E(3p+{+14}O){-rel}|?3 MeV, however the  
 17NA4c  sparse statistics are inconclusive for establishing this as a state.   
 17NA5c  The E(3p+{+14}O){-rel}=4.85 MeV peak is broader than expected, and the 
 17NA6c  authors suggest it may represent unresolved J|p=1/2+, 3/2+ and 5/2+    
 17NA7c  levels that are expected in the low-lying structure.                   
 17NA8c  As a result, a limit                                                   
 17NA9c  E(3p+{+14}O){-rel}|<4.85 MeV is indicated for {+17}Na{-g.s.}. A        
 17NAac  structureless background, associated with misidentified {+15}O         
 17NAbc  ejectiles, is discussed and subtracted.                                
 17NA c  A private communication with R.J. Charity (May 4, 2017) determines     
 17NA2c  -3.45 MeV|<S{-1p}|<1.4 MeV. In their analysis, the authors may find    
 17NA3c  evidence for involvement of the 1st excited state of {+16}Ne, however  
 17NA4c  the low statistics and high background prevent conclusive              
 17NA5c  determination of a sequential decay path, which would add further      
 17NA6c  constraint to S{-1p} and the mass excess (29.90 MeV|<|DM|<34.72 MeV).  
 17NA c  The authors give a significant discussion on the existing {+17}Na      
 17NA2c  ground state energy predictions.
