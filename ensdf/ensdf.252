252ES c  2000Ah02: {+256}Md was produced in reactions of {+253}Es(|a,2n) at     
252ES2c  the Argonne 152-cm cyclotron, and was removed from the target by a     
252ES3c  helium jet system and chemically isolated. |a, |g and |a-|g were       
252ES4c  measured with Si and Ge(Li) detectors. Five |a decays were observed    
252ES5c  and their energies were measured with samples covering small solid     
252ES6c  angle to the Si detector for minimizing |a-electron summing, and with  
252ES7c  calibration standards from 1991Ry01. Total 4 |g rays with E|g=99.4     
252ES8c  keV, 122.8 keV, 378.5 keV and 408.5 keV were observed in coincidence   
252ES9c  with the 7206-keV |a. One |g ray with E|g=445 keV {I1} was in          
252ESac  coincidence with the 7142-keV |a. These |g rays were not placed in     
252ESbc  the level scheme of {+252}Es because of the complexity of levels in    
252EScc  an odd-odd nucleus.

252ES c  The 5 |a branches are adopted from 2000Ah02 based on the following     
252ES2c  considerations. The peak shape of high energy and weak |a rays in the  
252ES3c  spectrum is clearly visible. No peaks with intensity larger than 1%    
252ES4c  are visible. In 1993Mo18, the determination of the high energy |a      
252ES5c  rays was not a unique solution because of poor detector resolution     
252ES6c  and conversion-electron summing incurred by the large detector solid   
252ES7c  angle (|?30% of 4|p). In 1971Ho16, the peaks in the region beyond 7.3  
252ES8c  MeV are statistically less certain. In 1970Fi12, the statistics in     
252ES9c  the high energy region are also poor to make a definite assignment of  
252ESac  every peak.

252NO2cA excited states can be estimated from systematics of hindrance factors  
252NO3cA (see 1998Ak04). |a decays of the neighboring nuclei suggest that       
252NO4cA HF(to 2+ state in {+252}No)=4.0 {I10} and the 2+ state energy is       
252NO5cA 40|+5 keV. By using these estimates, relative intensities are          
252NO6cA calculated as I|a(to g.s.)/I|a(2+ state)=84 {I4}/16 {I4}. If any |a    
252NO7cA transitions to higher energy levels can be neglected, these relative   
252NO8cA I|a's correspond to I|a's per 100 |a decays.

252NO7c  from the same experiment were also reported in 2006Le29, where         
252NO8c  recoil-fission tagging was used along with |a-decay tagging. The new   
252NO9c  results coincide with the older, but increase the statistics by        
252NOac  approximately 50%.
