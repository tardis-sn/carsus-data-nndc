262BH c  The half-lives listed above might indicate existence of various |a     
262BH2c  decaying isomeric states. The Q(|a)(266mt)=11480, obtained by 1995Au04 
262BH3c  from systematics, would suggest that the observed highest energy       
262BH4c  |a may decay from an isomeric state, not from the g.s. of              
262BH5c  266mt. One may speculate that the 10456- and 11739-keV |a's might      
262BH6c  decay from one isomeric state with T{-1/2}=4.2|+1.2 ms which probably  
262BH7c  is not the 266mt ground state; the 10484-, 10576-, 10682- and 10859-keV
262BH8c  |a's may decay from another state with T{-1/2}=0.27|+0.13 ms;          
262BH9c  and all others may decay from yet another state with                   
262BH7c  T{-1/2}=1.2|+0.5 ms, for example.                                      
262BH c  The authors of 1997Ho14 pointed out that the half-lives of these |a    
262BH2c  transitions can also be described by one common value of 1.7 ms        
262BH3c  {I+6-4}. The decay scheme for 266mt |a decay is obviously not complete;
262BH4c  additional supportive data are needed for construction of a definite   
262BH5c  decay scheme.
