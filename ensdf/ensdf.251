251   c  ABST$The experimental reaction and decay studies producing nuclei in   
251  2c  the A=251 mass chain have been reviewed.  Data on elements from        
251  3c  uranium (Z=92) to nobelium (Z=102) are included, and level and decay   
251  4c  schemes are presented for these nuclides.  This work supersedes the    
251  4c  previous evaluation for this mass chain (2013Br09).

251ES3cG conversion coefficients, which were not reported in 1978Ah02, were     
251ES4cG calculated from the I{-|g} and I{-ce} values reported.                 
251ES cG M$Based on the level scheme presented in 1978Ah02.  Mixed multipoles   
251ES2cG have been assumed except in cases where the J{+|p} values of the       
251ES3cG initial and final states or the measured conversion coefficients       
251ES4cG indicate only one multipole.
