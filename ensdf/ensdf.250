250U 5c  followed by chemical extraction and purification. The isotopic

250CM4cL (1957Hu76). T{-1/2}(SF)=11.3|*10{+3} y {I5} is recommended by 1989Ho24 
250CMxcL and 2000Ho27.                                                          
250CM cL           Any probable |a and |b{+-} decay branchings may Be deduced   
250CM2cL from estimated partial half-lives (see below): if                      
250CM3cL T{-1/2}(|a)=45.5|*10{+3} y {I7} and T{-1/2}(|b{+-})|?106|*10{+3} y,    
250CM4cL then, by using T{-1/2}(SF)=11.3|*10{+3} y, the total half-life and     
250CM5cL decay branchings are calculated as T{-1/2}|?8.3|*10{+3}, and %SF|?74,  
250CMxcL %|a|?18, %|b{+-}|?8.                                                   
250CM cL           From absence of {+250}Cf in debris of a thermonuclear        
250CM2cL explosion test, 1956Fi11 deduced that either {+250}Cm is stable        
250CM3cL against |b decay or its |b half-life is >130 y.                        
250CM cL           Because of the available Q(|b{+-})({+250}Cm)=37 {I11}, any |b
250CM2cL transition from {+250}Cm should populate only the 2- g.s. of {+250}Bk. 
250CM3cL Requirement of log| {If{+1u}t}|>8.5 yields                             
250CM4cL T{-1/2}(|b{+-})|>6.7|*10{+3} y. If log| {If{+1u}t}|?9.7, as it is for  
250CM5cL the {+250}Bk |b{+-} decay to {+250}Cf g.s., then                       
250CMxcL T{-1/2}(|b{+-})|?106|*10{+3} y.                                        
250CM cL           From r{-0} systematics (see 1998Ak04), r{-0}=1.515 {I5} is   
250CM2cL estimated; by using this r{-0} parameter, Q(|a)({+250}Cm)=5269 {I19}   
250CM3cL (from 1995Au04), I|a(unobserved 5086|a; g.s. to g.s.)=85 {I15} per 100 
250CM4cL |a decays [from systematics I|a(to g.s.)/I|a(to 2+) for the region],   
250CM5cL and by requiring that HF(5086|a)=1.0, the partial |a decay half-life   
250CM6cL of {+250}Cm is calculated as T{-1/2}(|a)=45.5|*10{+3} y {I7}.

250BK3cL |a decay and (n,|g) works, with two different level energies. The same 
250BK4cL configuration assignment was proposed by 1973Ah04 and by 1982HoZE.     
250BK5cL The order for these two gammas chosen here is mostly based on the      
250BK6cL intensity balance in |a decay at this level. However, uncertainties on 
250BK7cL the transition intensities of these gammas do not rule out the reverse 
250BK8cL order. Therefore, the level energy could very well Be 131.97 keV.      
250BK cL           Another reason for adopting this order is that if the        
250BK2cL 3+ state were at 131.97 keV, the rotational band parameter would       
250BK3cL Be much too small, assuming the assignment of the 148.60-keV level     
250BK2cL as the band's 4+ member is correct.

250BK3cL at 406-keV. However, in their preliminary |a decay work, 1982KoZZ      
250BK4cL observed a new |a to 406-keV level, presumably in addition to an       
250BK5cL |a to the 413-keV level. If the 6105|a is a doublet,                   
250BK6cL HF(|a to 406)|>22 which is consistent with an |a transition            
250BK7cL between the 7+,7(p 7/2[633],n 7/2[613])  parent and a                  
250BK8cL 6+,6(p 5/2[642],n 7/2[613]) daughter state. |a and |g spectra          
250BK9cL with higher resolution are needed to resolve whether or not these

250BK cL           1982KoZZ reported that 35 |a and 45 |g transitions           
250BK2cL were identified via their |a, |g and ce singles and coincidence        
250BK3cL spectra. The low-lying rotational bands, which were previously         
250BK4cL identified by 1966Mc02, were confirmed. Two new K=6 bands,             
250BK5cL 6+,(p 7/2[633]+n 5/2[622]) at 355.3 keV and                            
250BK5cL 6+,(p 5/2[642]+n 7/2[613]) at 406.3 keV, and two additional states     
250BK6cL at 316.1 with K=5+, and at 551.8 with possibly K=8 were                
250BK7cL proposed.                                                              
250BK cL           No level at about 355.3 keV was identified in (n,|g)         
250BK2cL reaction. However, the 6+,(p 7/2[633]+n 5/2[622]) state was            
250BK3cL assigned by 1985HoZM to a level at 552 keV from their (n,|g) data. An  
250BK4cL |a transition to such a state would be expected. However, since        
250BK5cL data on feeding and |DE-exciting these two levels are not available,   
250BK6cL no recommendation are given here.                                      
250BK cL           An |a from J|p=7+,K=7,(p 7/2[633],n 7/2[613]) parent         
250BK2cL to 5+,(p 7/2[633],n 3/2[622]) state at 316 keV, also proposed          
250BK3cL from (n,|g) work, should have a large |a-hindrance                     
250BK4cL factor. Its intensity is not available at this time, therefore its     
250BK5cL hindrance factor could not be calculated to verify the assignment.     
250BK cL           A level at 406 keV was observed in (n,|g) reaction by        
250BK2cL 1985HoZM and J|p=6+, K=6 (p 5/2[642],n 7/2[613]) was assigned.         
250BK3cL |a transition to such a state would be expected. Therefore, the        
250BK4cL level observed in {+254}Es |a decay at 406.3 keV is probably the 6+    
250BK5cL state proposed at 406 keV from the (n,|g) data, and presumably         
250BK6cL different than the one observed by 1966Mc02 and 1972Bb24 at 414 {I2}   
250BKxcL keV.

250BK c  The 39.3-h {+254}Es |a decay scheme presented here is basically that   
250BK2c  constructed by 1973Ah04. The 79.9 and 96.3 gammas were placed          
250BK3c  by 1973Ah04 to deexcite the 211.8-keV and 131.9-keV levels. In accord  
250BK4c  with the {+249}Bk(n,|g) work, the order of these two sequential |g rays
250BK5c  is reversed here, connecting through the 115.44-keV level.             
250BK c  Data from the 39.3-h {+254}Es and the decay scheme are being reanalyzed
250BK2c  by the authors of 1973Ah04, and their final results, together with     
250BK3c  their interpretations will be submitted for publication (priv. comm.   
250BK4c  from I. Ahmad). Until their work is completed, data and level scheme   
250BK5c  given here should be considered tentative.

250CF3cL of intraband transitions, and on level spacings. The large (d,d')      
250CF4cL cross section in population of the 3- member suggests                  
250CF5cL octupole-vibrational state. The band was populated in (|a,t) reaction  
250CF6cL through its two-proton component, (p 3/2[521],p 7/2[633]), and         
250CF7cL it was not seen in (d,p)

250CF2cL 1980Ah01 pointed out that similar energies of the first 0+ states      
250CF3cL in {+248}Cm (at 1084 keV) and in {+250}Cf (1154 keV) may suggest       
250CF4cL predominantly neutron configurations for them, and that neutron pair   
250CF5cL vibration character was deduced by 1977Fl06 for the 1084-keV level     
250CF6cL in {+248}Cm from (t,p) reaction.

250CF2cL 1980Ah01 suggested that the major components of this band are          
250CF3cL probably the (n 9/2[734], n 7/2[613])  and                             
250CF4cL (n 9/2[734], n 7/2[624]) configurations, and that the Coriolis         
250CF5cL interaction with the K=2- band at 1209.97 would take place through     
250CF6cL the n 7/2[613] state of this band and the n 5/2[622] state of the      
250CF7cL K=2- band. See 1980Ah01 for further discussions.

250CF cG           1980Ah03 suggested that the 1068.2|g decays from the 1,3-    
250CF2cG collective state seen in (d,d') at 1210 keV, to the 4+ state of        
250CF3cG the g.s. band. The authors pointed out that the expected 1167.4-keV    
250CF4cG transition from this 3- state to the 2+ of g.s. band would be          
250CF5cG obscured by the 1167.3|g which is placed to deexcite the 1210-keV      
250CF6cG 2-,( n 9/2[734], n 5/2[622]) state, identified in (d,p) reaction,      
250CF7cG to the 4+ g.s. band. On their level scheme, the 1068.2|g is shown      
250CF8cG however, to decay from the 2- state to the 4+ of g.s. band, competing  
250CF9cG with an E1 transition.                                                 
250CF cG           If the 1068.2 were to decay from the 3- state, an |e decay   
250CF2cG with |?0.1% intensity (deduced from intensity balance, excluding       
250CF3cG any contribution from possible 1167.4|g to the 4+ state) would have    
250CF4cG log| {Ift}|?8.8, which is quite small for a second-forbidden |b        
250CF5cG transition from the 1- parent. It is possible that the 1068.2|g is     
250CF6cG a doublet, decaying from both the 3- and 2- states at 1210 keV.        
250CF7cG Because of problems mentioned above, this |g is not placed on          
250CF8cG the decay scheme here.

250CF cL           The authors of 1976Ya02 utilized results from their          
250CF2cL {+249}Cf(|a,t) reaction and earlier work on {+250}Es |e decay in their 
250CF3cL J|p and configuration assignments. Since the {+249}Cf g.s. has the n   
250CF4cL 9/2[734] configuration, the two-quasineutron states, with one in the   
250CF5cL n 9/2[734] Nilsson state, are expected to be strongly excited in       
250CF6cL (d,p). As indicated by the intense |g transition between the 5-        
250CF7cL states observed in 8.6-h {+250}Es |e decay, the two K|p=5-             
250CF8cL two-quasiparticle bands are strongly mixed. Only the dominant          
250CF9cL two-quasiparticle components of the bands are given.

250FM2cA which is extrapolated from HF(8402|a from {+256}No to 2+ state in      
250FM3cA {+252}Fm)=4.8 {I8}, give I|a=14 {I4}. A similar trend to HF's for |a's 
250FM4cA from {+254}Fm and {+252}Fm nuclei is assumed in this extrapolation.
